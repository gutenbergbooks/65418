<p>&ldquo;Black bear steak!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grizzly bear, black bear, or cinnamon bear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is cinnamon bear! You don&rsquo;t suppose
members of the Black Bear Patrol, Boy Scouts
of America, would do a cannibal stunt by eating
black bear, do you? That wouldn&rsquo;t be
right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jimmie McGraw of the Wolf Patrol, City of
New York, and Frank Shaw, of the Black Bear
Patrol, also of New York City, were broiling
bear steak over a glowing bed of embers just
below the timber line on the eastern slope of
the Sierra Nevada mountains. It was early
morning in September, and the sunshine lay
like a mist of gold over the broken country.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">8</div>
<p>Away to the north rose the peaks of the
Matterhorn, approximately 13,000 feet above
sea level. Still nearer, Twin Peaks lifted their
white heads 12,000 feet in the air. To the east
lay Mono lake, salt and brackish to the taste,
partaking of the desert, but bright and glistening
now under the rays of the early sun.</p>
<p>To the south Warren Peak stood guard over
the head waters of the Tuolumne river. Westward
the tumbling waters of Rancheria creek
dropped down from crag to crag on their winding
way to the Pacific, nearly three hundred
miles distant. Here and there granite peaks
lifted white foreheads above the green of the
pines.</p>
<p>It was a glorious scene, and the Boy Scouts
were thoroughly in harmony with it. The
smoke of their campfire lifted in a straight line
to the blue of the sky, and the fragrance of their
steak and coffee permeated the sweet air.</p>
<p>The boys shivered a trifle as they gathered
closer about the embers, but they knew that before
many hours the chill of the night would be
swept away. While the boys tended the steak
and coffee, a voice came from a cave at the rear.
They both turned in that direction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does this hotel serve meals to guests in their
rooms?&rdquo; the voice asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">9</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sure we do!&rdquo; Jimmie McGraw replied. &ldquo;We
serve grizzly bear steak on toast, and on the
hoof at that; we&rsquo;re aiming to send you in a
whole animal in about ten minutes. We feed
folks right at this hotel!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack Bosworth yawned sleepily and came out
of the cavern to stand by the fire, warming his
hands and turning round and round in order to
take full advantage of the generous heat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are Ned and Harry?&rdquo; he asked in a
moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve gone out to get another bear for
breakfast,&rdquo; Jimmie replied. &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; he
went on, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re getting up such appetites, here
in the mountains, that it takes two hunters to
keep the provision chest full.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;After I eat,&rdquo; Jack said with a grin, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
going out and bring in a deer. I&rsquo;m getting tired
of bear steak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go to it!&rdquo; laughed Jimmie. &ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t
have any of this bear steak for breakfast, if
you&rsquo;re getting sick of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jimmie and Frank each seized a huge slice
of smoking steak and made for the cave, leaving
Jack to broil his own breakfast in punishment
for having found fault with the menu.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<p>The cave in which the boys found themselves
in a moment was not far from twenty feet in
size each way, with the ceiling at least ten feet
above the smooth floor. Perhaps thousands of
years before that day erosion or volcanic
action had honeycombed many of the granite
ridges looking to the east. These openings in
the ledge lay just at the timber line, as if nature
halted her vegetation there, angry at the interference
of contrary forces.</p>
<p>As the Boy Scouts had occupied the cave for
several days, it was comparatively well furnished
with crudely made tables, chairs, bunks,
and also with cooking utensils brought up from
San Francisco. Taken altogether it was an
ideal place in which to camp, being dry and
sightly.</p>
<p>Those who have read the previous volumes
of this series will not need introduction to the
five boys above mentioned. Ned Nestor and
Jimmie McGraw, of the Wolf Patrol, New York,
and Jack Bosworth, Frank Shaw and Harry
Stevens, of the Black Bear Patrol, New York,
had recently reached San Francisco after an
exciting experience with train robbers farther
to the north. The modern automobile which
they had used on that trip had been shipped
from Seattle to San Francisco by boat, the boys
not caring to make their way by motor down to
the Golden Gate.</p>
<p>A few days in San Francisco sufficed, for the
boys were out on their annual summer vacation,
and did not care to spend their time on city
pavements or in city apartments. So, leaving
their automobile in storage, they had departed
for the mountains in the vicinity of Twin Peaks.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<p>It is needless to say that they had enjoyed
every minute of the time since leaving San
Francisco. They had hunted deer, bear and
smaller game, and had fished in the clear waters
of the rapid streams which have their rise in the
Sierra Nevadas and finally empty the offerings
of the summits into San Francisco bay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Frank,&rdquo; Jimmie observed as the two
boys placed their still steaming steaks on paper
plates set out on a table made of slender mountain
poles, &ldquo;you take a bucket and go after
coffee and I&rsquo;ll bring out the bread and butter and
beans. We ought to have French fried potatoes
with these steaks, but I guess we can get along
with this feed for a few hours. Tell Jack to
come on in and eat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Frank Shaw took a tin pail from a shelf at
one side of the cave and started away toward
the campfire, while Jimmie made his way to a
corner of the cave which was shut off from the
main room by a heavy canvas curtain. Taking
a small electric flashlight from a pocket, he
drew the curtain aside and turned a finger of
flame upon a row of shelves arranged on the
face of the rock. This was known as the &ldquo;refrigerator.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<p>Jimmie whistled as he looked over the shelves
and reached out a hand, almost automatically,
for the things he needed for the table. Then his
puckered lips opened in wonder and he glanced
sharply about the cavern.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Now I wonder what
they did that for!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did what?&rdquo; demanded Frank Shaw, returning
with the pail of fragrant coffee. &ldquo;Who did
what?&rdquo; repeated the newcomer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe you did it!&rdquo; insisted Jimmie with a
grin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything wrong with your gearing this
morning?&rdquo; asked Frank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Jimmie went on, &ldquo;some of you boys
went and took the last three loaves of bread
we had in the refrigerator, and all the butter
there was in sight, and all that was left of the
roast haunch we had such trouble with yesterday.
I&rsquo;ll bet you did it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw, you did it yourself!&rdquo; exclaimed Frank.
&ldquo;I heard you moving around in the night, and
wondered then what it was you were eating.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Up in the night?&rdquo; repeated Jimmie. &ldquo;Not
me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Someone was out of bed in the night!&rdquo; insisted
Frank. &ldquo;I heard someone walking
around the cave and stirring up the fire. It
must have been about midnight, or a little
after.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t me!&rdquo; Jimmie declared, continuing
his search in the cupboard for more eatables.
&ldquo;It sure wasn&rsquo;t me up in the night!&rdquo;</p>
<p>After continuing his examination of the refrigerator
for a moment, he handed the search
light to Frank and sat down on a corner of the
table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here, Frank,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;take this
search light and see if you can find anything at
all in that refrigerator. I left canned beans in
there, and condensed milk, and a tomato can
full of sugar, and about a dozen eggs! Now you
just take this light and see if you can find anything
like that on the shelves. I&rsquo;m flabbergasted!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Frank&rsquo;s face showed only amusement as he
took the flashlight and threw its rays over the
rude shelves. When he saw that Jimmie had
not been joking over the disappearance of the
food, but had told the exact truth, he, too, sat
down on a corner of the table and looked about
the cavern suspiciously. When the boy&rsquo;s eyes
met, they grinned sheepishly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go and ask Jack,&rdquo; Frank finally suggested.</p>
<p>Leaving their cooling breakfast on the table,
both boys finally dashed out of the cave and
ran around a sharp corner or rock to where Jack
Bosworth was broiling bear steak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you do it, Jack?&rdquo; Frank shouted as
they came up to him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>&ldquo;You bet I did!&rdquo; Jack replied, turning a very
red face to his chums, and drawing his now
thoroughly cooked steak from the fire. &ldquo;You
bet I did do it. What is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you ever manage it?&rdquo; asked Jimmie
with a wrinkling of his freckled nose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did I ever manage it?&rdquo; repeated Jack.
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the answer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jimmie took his chum by the arm and headed
for the cave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bring your breakfast along with you,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;and hold onto it tight. Clutch it with
the grip of destiny! I&rsquo;ll show you what I&rsquo;m
talking about, and then you can tell me who&rsquo;s
got the appetite.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Directly the three boys stood before the roughly
built cupboard and then Frank drew aside the
canvas curtain. The shelves were entirely bare
except for knives, forks, spoons, a sack of salt,
and an empty plate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; Jimmie cried. &ldquo;Did you go and
eat all our perfectly good provender last night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t out of bed last night!&rdquo; insisted Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it must have been Ned or Harry!&rdquo;
Frank declared.</p>
<p>Jack looked from one to the other with amazement
showing in his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did some one clean out the refrigerator in
the night?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re just right, some one cleaned out the
refrigerator!&rdquo; Jimmie answered, &ldquo;and we&rsquo;ve
got to go and make baking powder biscuit, or
corn pones, or something like that for breakfast,
or go hungry!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess this bear steak will be all right for
me,&rdquo; Jack replied. &ldquo;I always did like bear
steak and coffee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to make any biscuit, or cook
any corn pones!&rdquo; Frank exclaimed. &ldquo;Let the
kids that robbed the refrigerator do the cooking!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ned or Harry got busy in the night all
right enough!&rdquo; Jack insisted.</p>
<p>At that moment Ned Nestor and Harry
Stevens, the other members of the party,
entered the cavern, dressed in neat khaki uniform,
as were, in fact, all the boys, and approached
the table where the bear steaks lay
exposed. Harry seized a knife and fork and
laughingly prepared to attack Jack&rsquo;s breakfast.
Jack seized the meat and darted out into the
sunlight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a nice way to serve a guest you&rsquo;ve
invited to breakfast!&rdquo; Harry exclaimed. &ldquo;Where
do I get my eatings this morning?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You and Ned got yours last night!&rdquo; Jimmie
grinned.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we did?&rdquo; queried Harry. &ldquo;Perhaps Ned
got his last night, but if I got mine I don&rsquo;t
know it. What are you talking about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go and look in the refrigerator,&rdquo; suggested
Jimmie.</p>
<p>Both Ned and Harry walked to the corner
and drew aside the curtain. They stood in
front of the empty shelves for a moment, and
then walked back to the table, their faces showing
only amusement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you do with it?&rdquo; asked Ned,
presently, as Jimmie and Frank attacked their
fast-cooling steaks vigorously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did <i>you</i> do with it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Frank answered the question by asking one.</p>
<p>Ned Nestor&rsquo;s face became serious in a moment.
He glanced from one chum to the other, and
then went to the shelves and looked them over
thoroughly. There was a puzzled line between
his eyebrows as he walked back and seated himself
beside Jimmie and Frank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Honest, now, boys,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;what does
this all mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you get the eatings?&rdquo; asked Jimmie
seriously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I certainly did not!&rdquo; replied Nestor, seriously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now about you, Harry?&rdquo; Jimmie questioned.
&ldquo;Where did you find a market for all that good
provender?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<p>&ldquo;Never touched it!&rdquo; Harry insisted. &ldquo;I
went to bed at nine o&rsquo;clock, as you all know, and
when I awoke the sun was just showing his nose
over the foothills.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you were good and hungry, too, just
about that time!&rdquo; Jimmie scoffed. &ldquo;You must
have been hungry to eat all that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a minute, boys,&rdquo; Ned replied. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
something mysterious about this! No wild
animal ever entered the cave last night. Some
creature on two legs stripped the refrigerator
while we slept!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Je-rusalem!&rdquo; exclaimed Jimmie. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a
wonder he didn&rsquo;t do something more than steal
our grub.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t suppose,&rdquo; Frank cut in, &ldquo;that there
was a human being anywhere in this district
except ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Ned replied, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s some one prowling
about, and the thing for us to do is to find
out who it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the mystery of the thing that gets me!&rdquo;
declared Frank.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER II</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">A VOICE IN THE THICKET</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just what it is&mdash;a mystery!&rdquo; Jimmie
McGraw exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How could anyone get in here and lug away
a load of provisions like that without our waking
up? They just couldn&rsquo;t do it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This from Jack, who had now returned with
his half-eaten steak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard some one moving around in the
night,&rdquo; Frank declared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, why didn&rsquo;t you get up and see about
it?&rdquo; asked Ned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I thought I dreamed it!&rdquo; grinned Frank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d give a good deal to know who it was that
had the nerve to pay us a visit in the night-time,&rdquo;
Ned said, presently. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like the
idea of keeping open house during the dark
hours. The person who came here last night
may come again, and may make more trouble
the next time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that means,&rdquo; Jimmie complained, &ldquo;that
we&rsquo;ve got to set a guard every night, and watch
our property, just like we were on Third Avenue
in New York. It makes me sick to think of it!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<p>&ldquo;And just think of all the fun we&rsquo;ve been
having here, playing that we were scores of
miles away from anybody! Look here, boys,&rdquo;
he went on, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve been under the sea and
over the sea. We&rsquo;ve had adventures in Panama
and in China, and I don&rsquo;t think we ever had
anyone walk over our sleeping forms and steal
provisions before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right!&rdquo; Frank answered. &ldquo;We must
be getting careless in our old age. Now the
next thing is to find out who did this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some poor tramp, probably,&rdquo; suggested
Ned. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll make a business of watching for
him during the next few hours, and probably
we&rsquo;ll catch him. I&rsquo;m sure I hope it was a
tramp, for I don&rsquo;t want to get mixed up with
any hostile element up here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Ned ceased speaking he went to the rough
cupboard again and began a second inspection
of the shelves. Newspapers had been neatly
arranged on the boards, and these did not appear
to have been disturbed. After going over
everything in sight thoroughly, the boy took
the sack of salt out to the open sunlight and
examined it critically.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, what do you
find there?&rdquo; demanded Frank. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you
what,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;we have seemed to forget
that Dad owns one of the leading newspapers in
New York City! I will sit down right now and
write a long article and call it &lsquo;The Magic
Breakfast; or, Who Stole the Beans!&rsquo; I think
that title would make a hit on the Bowery, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s about time you began sending in correspondence,&rdquo;
Jimmie grinned. &ldquo;You know
you promised to send in a full account of our
ruction with the train robbers, but you never
did. The first thing you know, your father
will be cutting off your supply of ready cash.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, then,&rdquo; Frank laughed, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll retain
Jack&rsquo;s father, who is a rich corporation lawyer,
and sue Dad for a breach of promise, or something
like that. But look at Ned,&rdquo; the boy
went on, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s surely found something on that
salt sack!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that right, Sherlocko, you Sleuth?&rdquo; asked
Jimmie.</p>
<p>Ned turned to his chums with amusement
showing in his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me read you the story told by the salt
sack,&rdquo; he said whimsically. &ldquo;And remember,&rdquo;
he went on, as the boys laughed and nudged
each other, &ldquo;this story will not be reprinted in
book form, so you&rsquo;ll have to catch it as I tell
it. It will not even be told again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on with your blessed old dope,&rdquo; laughed
Frank.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Ned began, holding the sack up for
inspection, &ldquo;the person who stole our provisions
took salt from this sack in order to season his
meal. He took quite a lot, too, judging from
the way the salt lowered during the night.
Probably thought he&rsquo;d take enough while the
taking was good, for which we can&rsquo;t blame him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We knew all that before!&rdquo; Jimmie declared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now listen,&rdquo; Ned went on, &ldquo;here comes the
magic part of the case! The person who took
the salt from this sack was fifteen years of age.
He was tall and slender, and had gone without
food for three days. He did not come down
from the divide, but crept up from the valley.
He was lightly clad, and wore a ragged coat and
broken shoes. He stood outside the cave for a
long time before gaining courage to enter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys gathered around Ned with laughing
faces and pretended to inspect the salt bag with
reverential interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on, now,&rdquo; Jimmie demanded. &ldquo;Go on
and give us the answer to all this! Tell us how
you know so much about a person you have
never seen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; Ned explained, &ldquo;I know the
person was a boy because the finger marks on
the sack show a small, slender hand. Slender
fingers represent a slender body, you know, and
that&rsquo;s why I say the person was young and
slim.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good deduction!&rdquo; Frank declared.
&ldquo;Now tell us how you know that he hadn&rsquo;t
had anything to eat for three days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at the shelves and you&rsquo;ll discover how
I know for yourselves,&rdquo; Ned said, marching
the boys into the back end of the cave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will notice,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;that the
shelf where the bread lay is covered with crumbs.
That shows that he began to eat the minute his
hands touched the loaf. He must have been
perfectly ravenous to begin his meal while in
such imminent danger of discovery. Of course,
he might have dined in less than three days, but
I think he&rsquo;d have to be pretty hungry in order
to eat with five boys likely to wake up at any
moment lying around him. You see that, don&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good, too!&rdquo; Jack exclaimed. &ldquo;Now,
how do you know whether he came down the
slope to the timber line or up the slope from the
valley?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you notice the floor directly in front of the
shelves,&rdquo; Ned explained pointing, &ldquo;you will see
numerous pine leaves scattered about. Now,
there are no pines above the cavern, so the boy
crawled through the thickets below. Is that
clear?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<p>&ldquo;Clear as mud!&rdquo; shouted Frank, &ldquo;and suppose
you have got a photograph of him so that
you know that he was ragged and wore broken
shoes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at the nail sticking out of the shelf,&rdquo;
Ned went on, &ldquo;and you&rsquo;ll see several shreds of
cloth hanging to it. Jack thought he was making
a pretty good job on that cupboard but he
left a nail sticking up, just the same. The nail
tells the story of a ragged sleeve.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Correct!&rdquo; laughed Jimmie. &ldquo;Now, how
are you going to make good on the broken
shoes?&rdquo; he continued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the easiest part of it all,&rdquo; Ned answered.
&ldquo;When he stood in the cool ashes close
to the embers, he left imprints of wornout soles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys broke into shouts of laughter and
Frank declared that he would immortalize Ned
as a detective in his father&rsquo;s newspaper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but hold on!&rdquo; Jack interposed. &ldquo;Did
you hold a stop watch on him while he stood
outside the cave, Ned?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He held a stop watch on himself,&rdquo; the boy
answered. &ldquo;You can see where he walked about,
taking many steps and stirring up the wash
from the rocks at the mouth of the cave. Now
do you understand?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now, then,&rdquo; Jimmie questioned, &ldquo;perhaps
you can tell us where this boy is, and why he
didn&rsquo;t make himself known to us if he was as
hungry as you say he was. Go on, now, and
tell!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And while you&rsquo;re about it,&rdquo; Jack suggested,
&ldquo;you might as well tell us whether the boy who
stole our grub is white or black or mixed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are limits to the ability of even a
Sherlock Holmes,&rdquo; laughed Ned, &ldquo;but,&rdquo; he continued,
more seriously, &ldquo;there is little doubt
that the person who stole our provisions is
just about as I have described him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys now gathered about the fire again,
and Ned and Harry proceeded to broil steaks
for their breakfast. After a time Jimmie and
Frank wandered down into the pines in the hope
of securing the material for a squirrel stew for a
dinner.</p>
<p>It was still and dim in the thicket except for
the ceaseless murmur of the trees. The sun&rsquo;s
rays could not penetrate the heavy foliage.
Here and there great rocks, evidently shunted
down from the summits in some convulsion of
nature, lay scattered about.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Talk about your weird places,&rdquo; Jimmie exclaimed,
&ldquo;this beats any graveyard I ever saw!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s no dream!&rdquo; Frank answered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
been hearing ghostly voices for the last ten
minutes. Listen, and you will hear them, too!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<p>Before the words were well out of the boy&rsquo;s
mouth, Jimmie caught him by the arm and drew
him to the shelter of a great tree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you say about ghostly voices?&rdquo; he
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw, that was just a joke!&rdquo; Frank replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I did actually hear some one speak!&rdquo;
Jimmie insisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you heard anything at all it was a bear, or
a deer, or a squirrel or something like that!&rdquo;
Frank declared. &ldquo;Just you wait a minute and
see if you don&rsquo;t hear some bear ordering us off
his premises.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While the boys stood close to the bole of a
pine, listening, a shrill, excited voice came to
them from some undiscoverable quarter.</p>
<p>At first they could not distinguish the words
which were spoken. Jimmie turned to his chum
with a half frightened grin on his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does that sound like bear-talk?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a bit of it!&rdquo; Frank admitted, &ldquo;but it
may be one of the boys playing a joke on us.
They are full of such tricks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the voice came to their ears again,
lifted just above the sighing of the pines&mdash;sharp,
imperative.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beat it! Beat it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two boys gazed into each other&rsquo;s faces
with wonder in their eyes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<p>&ldquo;Can you beat that?&rdquo; Jimmie asked. &ldquo;Was
that a bear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again the words of warning came to the ears
of the amazed boys:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beat it while the going is good!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That sounds like Second avenue!&rdquo; Jimmie
ventured.</p>
<p>Frank turned in the direction from whence
the sound had seemed to proceed and called
out:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your motto?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be prepared!&rdquo; was the answer that came
back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be prepared for what?&rdquo; demanded Jimmie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To help a friend!&rdquo; was the answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here!&rdquo; Jimmie shouted. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re a
Boy Scout, why don&rsquo;t you come out and show
yourself? I never knew a Boy Scout who was
ashamed to show his face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What patrol?&rdquo; came the voice from the
thicket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Black Bear and Wolf, New York,&rdquo; Frank
answered.</p>
<p>There was a short silence, and then just a
whisper came from a point near to where the
boys were standing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I tell you Boy Scouts to beat it?&rdquo;
were the words spoken.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the difficulty?&rdquo; asked Jimmie. &ldquo;Are
you trying to make monkeys of us? Why don&rsquo;t
you come out and tell us all about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t do any good if I did,&rdquo; answered
the mysterious voice. &ldquo;I tell you to beat it,
and that&rsquo;s the last word you&rsquo;ll get from me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They heard a rustle in the thicket, and, though
they listened for a long time, they heard no
more words spoken. The boys darted away
into the undergrowth in search of the person
who had given them so mysterious a warning,
but no trace of him could be discovered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, what did he mean by &lsquo;beat it&rsquo;?&rdquo;
demanded Jimmie in a moment as the boys met
at the tree again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He meant for us to make ourselves scarce
in this vicinity, I&rsquo;m afraid,&rdquo; Frank answered.
&ldquo;Of course we don&rsquo;t know whether he warned
us to keep away from this spot, or whether he
advised us to break camp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he thinks we&rsquo;re going to break camp on
any bum old steer like that,&rdquo; Jimmie grumbled,
&ldquo;he&rsquo;s got several more thinks coming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyway,&rdquo; laughed Frank, &ldquo;we wouldn&rsquo;t
feel just right unless we got into some kind of a
mysterious situation. We&rsquo;ve never been out
on a trip that we didn&rsquo;t butt into something
desperate and uncanny.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<p>After another investigation of the locality,
the boys hastened back to camp. They were
met by Harry and Jack, who regarded them
with inquiring eyes, seeming to be astonished
by their return.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Ned?&rdquo; Jack finally asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, we left him here,&rdquo; both boys replied
in a breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; Harry returned, &ldquo;but you sent
a line asking him to come to where you were.
What did you go and do that for if you were
coming right back to camp? Was that a joke?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Joke nothing!&rdquo; Jimmie answered. &ldquo;We
never sent any such word!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then who sent that strange note?&rdquo; Jack
asked. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet we&rsquo;re up against something
mighty serious right now!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER III</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE LAW OF CLUB AND FANG</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the note?&rdquo; asked Frank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t here,&rdquo; Harry answered, &ldquo;so I guess
Ned must have taken it with him. He had it
the last time I saw it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What kind of a note was it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just a short note written on letter paper in
pencil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what did it say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It said for Ned to come to where you were,
and leave the others in camp. You say you
never sent it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, we never sent it!&rdquo; replied Jimmie
scornfully. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t carry paper and pencil
with us every time we leave camp!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who brought it?&rdquo; Frank cut in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, a dark-skinned little chap who said
he had left you in a gulch not far away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he look like the boy Ned described this
morning?&rdquo; asked Jimmie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come to think of it, I guess he did!&rdquo; answered
Jack. &ldquo;Anyway, he was a ragged little
chap and looked hungry.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hungry after eating three or four loaves
of bread and a lot of canned beans!&rdquo; grinned
Frank. &ldquo;Did Ned go away with him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, he went away with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then there&rsquo;s some deviltry afloat,&rdquo; Frank
declared. &ldquo;Some one out there in the thicket
told us to &lsquo;beat it while the beating was good,&rsquo;
and then ducked away. I&rsquo;ll bet it was the same
person.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In answer to numerous questions, Jimmie and
Frank related their experience in the pines.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, what are we going to do about it?&rdquo;
asked Harry with a troubled look on his face.
&ldquo;There certainly is mischief afoot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The first thing to do,&rdquo; Jack replied, &ldquo;is to
scatter and see if we can find Ned. He&rsquo;s been
lured away, and may be in trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re the original trouble-getters!&rdquo; Harry
grumbled. &ldquo;I believe we&rsquo;d get into a mixup
of some kind if we went to a Sunday School
picnic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the strangest part of it all is,&rdquo; Frank
went on, &ldquo;that the boy who told us to &lsquo;beat it&rsquo;
proved to be a Boy Scout!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyway,&rdquo; Jimmie declared, &ldquo;he answered
our challenge correctly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While the boys consulted together, anxious
for the safety of their chum, a shout came from
the summit above.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s something new,&rdquo; Jimmie grinned.
&ldquo;I wonder whether that fellow wants bread
and beans, or whether he wants to coax one of
us away into the woods? Tell him this is our
busy day!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you there, boys?&rdquo; came the voice from
above.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello yourself!&rdquo; Jimmie called back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, now,&rdquo; the voice went on. &ldquo;All I
needed was something to enable me to locate
you. I&rsquo;ll be down there in a minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;ll be nice!&rdquo; Jimmie answered. &ldquo;If
you&rsquo;ve got a trunk full of trouble, just bring
that along with you. We&rsquo;re in the market for
trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although the boys made light of the approach
of another visitor, they were very anxious.
They were certain that Ned had been lured away
for some sinister purpose, and were consequently
fearful that this new arrival might be connected
in some way with future complications.</p>
<p>In a few moments rolling stones and exclamations
of impatience announced the near approach
of the man who had hailed them. Directly he
turned around an angle of rock and came into
full view.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<p>He was a short, fat, heavily built man of
perhaps thirty, with the pale face and assertive
manner of a city dweller. At all events it was
plainly evident that he was not familiar with
mountain work, for he stumbled about as he advanced
down the declivity, and more than once
fell to his knee and caught hold of projecting
boulders with a pair of hands not at all familiar
with such service.</p>
<p>Jack eyed the fellow critically for a moment,
and then advanced to meet him with a shout of
welcome.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gilroy!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;What the Old Harry
are you doing away out in California? Boys,&rdquo;
he continued, turning to his chums, &ldquo;this is
Gilroy, one of Dad&rsquo;s confidential clerks. Nothing
wrong at home, I hope,&rdquo; he continued addressing
the newcomer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All were well and happy when I left New
York,&rdquo; Gilroy returned, puffing with his long
struggle with the mountain side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did Dad give you a vacation?&rdquo; asked Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vacation nothing!&rdquo; Gilroy answered. &ldquo;He
sent me flying over the continent on a special
train, and told me to get to you in seven days.
This is the tenth day I&rsquo;ve been on the road.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whew!&rdquo; whistled Jack. &ldquo;Dad won&rsquo;t like
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, but I can&rsquo;t help it,&rdquo; Gilroy returned.
&ldquo;Your father measured surface distances
only. He didn&rsquo;t figure how many
thousands of miles I&rsquo;d have to go up in the air
in order to find you!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<p>&ldquo;It is some climb,&rdquo; Jack admitted, &ldquo;but
what&rsquo;s the rush?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;ve got a place here where we can talk
without being in danger of being overheard,&rdquo;
Gilroy suggested, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you all about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh you can say whatever you have to say
in the presence of my chums,&rdquo; Jack answered.
&ldquo;They won&rsquo;t leak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That isn&rsquo;t the idea,&rdquo; Gilroy stated. &ldquo;Your
father even instructed me to report to your
chums if you were not to be found. I know the
boys are all right, but the fact is that he is
afraid of rank outsiders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rank outsiders!&rdquo; repeated Jack with a
laugh. &ldquo;Who is there up here on the mountain
to listen to private conversation? Eavesdroppers
couldn&rsquo;t get within sound of our voices without
being seen if they tried.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They couldn&rsquo;t, eh?&rdquo; Harry cut in. &ldquo;They
couldn&rsquo;t get close enough to steal our beans, or
to tell you boys to beat it while the beatin&rsquo; was
good, or to send a fake note in order to get hold
of Ned!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that you say?&rdquo; asked Gilroy. &ldquo;Has
Ned Nestor already been lured away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He certainly has!&rdquo; answered Jimmie.
&ldquo;While Frank and I were away a strange boy
brought a note and Ned fell for it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<p>&ldquo;And some one stole your provisions, too?&rdquo;
the fat clerk asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stole everything last night that wasn&rsquo;t
locked up in the provisions boxes,&rdquo; answered
Harry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And appeared to us in the bushes and told
us to beat it,&rdquo; put in Jimmie. &ldquo;I wonder if he
did that before he brought that lying note to
Ned? Oh, we seem to be keeping busy all
right!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; Frank suggested, &ldquo;he must have seen
us before he brought the note, for he went away
with Ned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gilroy looked very much puzzled for a
moment and then said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid that this is a scheme to get Nestor
out of the way. If I could only have reached
you on schedule time, this would never have
happened. Still, I did the best I could under the
circumstances.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you also didn&rsquo;t come out here to tell
us to &lsquo;beat it,&rsquo;&rdquo; laughed Frank. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve just
got to enjoying ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I came out to deliver a message from Mr.
Bosworth,&rdquo; Gilroy answered. &ldquo;He has some
work he wants you boys to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Work is right in our line!&rdquo; Harry answered
with a laugh.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, hurry up and tell us all about it,&rdquo;
Jack suggested calmly, &ldquo;because, you know, we
ought to be out looking for Ned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just this way,&rdquo; Gilroy began, &ldquo;Jack&rsquo;s
father is acting as attorney for a large mining
corporation. His employers have always believed
their title to certain lands in this vicinity
absolutely flawless. Some of these lands are
valuable for timber, some for minerals, and
some for agricultural purposes. As I said before,
some of these lands lie in this vicinity, and
a railroad the employers own will soon build a
spur in here to market the minerals and the
lumber.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; the confidential clerk went on, &ldquo;it
has been discovered that there are other claimants
to these lands. It is asserted that they
were given to the descendants of Franciscan
monks who were here at the time so many
missions were scattered over California. At
any rate, people who came over with the Franciscans,
if not Franciscans themselves, left
progeny who now claim these lands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Mexican government recognized the
titles, but the United States government never
did. The claimants have no standing whatever
in the courts, but they propose to keep possession
under the old law of club and fang. Of
course, they can&rsquo;t keep possession long, but they
can put the corporation to a great deal of
trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<p>&ldquo;It looks to me,&rdquo; Jack interrupted with a
grin, &ldquo;that father should have sent a regiment
of United States troops instead of one confidential
clerk. Now, just what is it he wants
us to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He wants you boys to scout about and find
out exactly who is at the bottom of all this
trouble. He believes that the alleged heirs are
ignorant pawns in the hands of a corporation
with which his own companies are at sword&rsquo;s
points.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His first thought was to send a company of
detectives in here, but he concluded later on
that a vacation crowd of Boy Scouts would attract
less attention, and might not be suspected
at all. In accordance with this reasoning he
sent me out to tell you to learn everything possible
regarding present complications.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does he think this corporation he is fighting
has already sent mercenaries out here to make
trouble?&rdquo; asked Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is quite positive that such is the case,&rdquo;
answered Gilroy. &ldquo;At any rate, he wants you
to find out what kind of people they have leading
this outlaw gang.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<p>&ldquo;I knew it would come,&rdquo; Jack laughed.
&ldquo;Every time we go out for a vacation, we get
mixed up in a scrap of some kind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Frank suggested, &ldquo;we have all the
more fun because of the trouble we get into. I
like to be doing things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how are we going to get a line on these
people?&rdquo; asked Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems to me that they&rsquo;ve got in the first
blow,&rdquo; Harry declared. &ldquo;If we only had Ned
here, he could tell us exactly what to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have him here before night!&rdquo; Jimmie
answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ask how you are to get a line on the
people you are to watch,&rdquo; Gilroy said, &ldquo;and I
think I can tell you what you ought to do first.
It is said that somewhere out in the hills, perhaps
within a few miles of this very spot, there
are the ruins of an old Franciscan mission. It
is said to stand high up on a mountain, facing
east. Our information is that the walls of the
original mission have been leveled to the ground,
but that the subterranean rooms and passages
reaching under the mountain are still fairly
intact. You must find this mission.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And after we find it, what then?&rdquo; Jack asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is said to be the headquarters of the outlaw
claimants who are making us all this
trouble,&rdquo; replied Gilroy. &ldquo;If you find the
ruined mission, you will also find, without
doubt, the agents of the corporation we are fighting.
They are undoubtedly there.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<p>&ldquo;And after we find them, what then?&rdquo; Frank
questioned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What Mr. Bosworth wants,&rdquo; the confidential
clerk continued, &ldquo;is to connect this
hostile corporation, through its agents, with
what is going on here. Once in the possession
of positive information that the corporation is
instigating this revolt against law and order,
and he will know exactly what to do. He expects
you boys to bring in the proof.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you going to remain and help us?&rdquo;
asked Jack in a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remain and help you?&rdquo; repeated the fat
little confidential clerk in dismay. &ldquo;I should
say not! In fact, Mr. Bosworth was thoughtful
enough to intimate to me that I would better
get out of the mountains as soon as possible
after delivering my message. Personally, I
wouldn&rsquo;t stay in these hills for a thousand dollars
a day!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll wait until we find this romantic
old mission,&rdquo; Jack grinned, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll make you a
suite of rooms that will beat anything in New
York.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<p>&ldquo;Say, boys,&rdquo; Gilroy answered with a grim
smile, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather be blind and be tied to a lamp
post in New York than to own all the country
west of the Mississippi river.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; Jack said, &ldquo;run back to Dad
with your little old story about Ned&rsquo;s being
abducted the day you reached us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you do,&rdquo; Jimmie called out, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll murder
you when we get back to New York! Ned will
be with us before you get down to the foot-hills.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I certainly hope so,&rdquo; Gilroy answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; Jimmie declared, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re going out
right now to find that romantic old mission and
dig him out of a ruined chamber!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER IV</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">JIMMIE BUILDS TWO FIRES</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;I am really alarmed about the disappearance
of Mr. Nestor,&rdquo; Gilroy said, as the boys began
frying ham and eggs and making fresh coffee for
him. &ldquo;There is no doubt at all in my mind that
he was induced to leave the camp by the agents
of the hostile corporation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No doubt about that,&rdquo; Jimmie put in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that means,&rdquo; Gilroy went on, &ldquo;that
they really suspect what you are here for. That
is the worst part of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why should they suspect us?&rdquo; demanded
Jimmie. &ldquo;We never knew a thing about the
complications until you came in here half an
hour ago!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you why they&rsquo;re suspicious of us,&rdquo;
Jack exclaimed. &ldquo;They know that I am the
son of the lawyer who is putting up the fight
against them. Now you see how the case
stands! We&rsquo;ve been given a mission to execute
on the theory that we could work without being
suspected, when, as a matter of fact, we were
suspected before we were given the work to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s funny!&rdquo; Jimmie laughed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<p>&ldquo;It might be humorous if it wasn&rsquo;t so
serious,&rdquo; the confidential clerk explained, pompously,
&ldquo;and I&rsquo;m going to give you boys a
little advice, which may not meet with the
approval of Jack&rsquo;s father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go to it!&rdquo; laughed Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This hostile corporation,&rdquo; Gilroy continued,
&ldquo;will, in my opinion, stop at nothing in order
to accomplish their ends. Now that the unexpected
has happened&mdash;now that their agents
suspect that you are here to watch and, if possible,
frustrate their designs&mdash;my advice is that
you get out of the country as quickly as possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And leave Ned here?&rdquo; demanded Jimmie
scornfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you boys break camp and leave the
mountains at once,&rdquo; Gilroy advised, &ldquo;the agents
of the corporation will not hold Nestor for any
great length of time. Nestor, as you boys well
know, has an international reputation for clever
work in the detective line. Still, it is well
known, that he works with Boy Scouts invariably,
and the people who have abducted him
will understand that he would be likely to
abandon any case not shared with his old chums.
Am I right in that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got it sized up right!&rdquo; declared
Jimmie.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder why they didn&rsquo;t trap me?&rdquo; Jack
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I rather wonder at that, too,&rdquo; Gilroy answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh,&rdquo; laughed Frank. &ldquo;They wanted the
detective, and not the son of his father. To
capture Jack would be to admit that their
efforts were directed against the corporations
under the control of Mr. Bosworth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; the confidential clerk insisted, &ldquo;I am
certain that, under the circumstances, Mr. Bosworth
would object to your remaining here on
any errand of his. For my own part, I advise
you to get out of the mountains as soon as
possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And miss all this fun?&rdquo; demanded Jimmie
with a grin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I insist that you boys are in deadly
peril here!&rdquo; Gilroy went on. &ldquo;Urged on by the
agents of this hostile corporation, there is no
knowing what desperate measures these outlaw
claimants may resort to. But if you insist on
remaining here against my advice, and against
the advice your father would give if he understood
the circumstances, you ought to move
your camp to some place not in the knowledge
of the outlaws. You can at least do that.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the use?&rdquo; asked Jack. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you
suppose they&rsquo;ve got people watching us now?
From this time on, we can&rsquo;t make a move without
their knowing it. We may as well stay
here and barricade this cave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a good idea!&rdquo; Jimmie exclaimed.
&ldquo;All we&rsquo;ve got to do is to roll a few large
boulders down the slope and line them up at the
entrance of the cavern. We&rsquo;ll be as snug as bugs
in a rug in behind them, and we have provisions
enough to last us for a month.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Harry submitted, &ldquo;and we can lay
behind the boulders and shoot outlaws and railroad
mercenaries to our hearts&rsquo; content!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s dangerous, boys, it&rsquo;s dangerous!&rdquo; insisted
Gilroy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh, we&rsquo;re just beginning to enjoy ourselves,
now that we have some object in life!&rdquo;
Jimmie insisted.</p>
<p>The boys set to work with a vim rolling
boulders down the slope and placing them in
front of the cave. It was the work of only a few
minutes to barricade the entire entrance to
within a foot of the top, leaving only a narrow
place to pass in and out. Thus protected, the
cave was quite dark but the electric flashlights
carried by the boys would, they considered,
supply sufficient illumination.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; Jimmie said, regarding the work
critically, &ldquo;we can give our whole attention to
learning what has become of Ned.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<p>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t mind, boys,&rdquo; Gilroy interrupted,
&ldquo;I wish you&rsquo;d give a little attention to
the ham and eggs and coffee you are preparing
for my breakfast! This mountain air creates
an appetite.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure thing!&rdquo; Harry shouted. &ldquo;We forgot
all about your breakfast, and there&rsquo;s the ham
burning and the coffee bubbling over. But just
you wait a minute,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;and we&rsquo;ll
soon have a meal better than any you could get
at the Waldorf-Astoria!&rdquo;</p>
<p>While the breakfast was being cooked and
eaten, Gilroy continued to urge the boys to go
out with him and wait at the nearest transportation
point for Ned to follow them. The
boys only laughed at the idea, however, and
ended by urging him to remain with them until
Ned should be brought back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what I&rsquo;ll do, boys,&rdquo; the confidential
clerk finally stated, &ldquo;if you&rsquo;ll give me a
big roll of blankets and leave someone on watch,
I&rsquo;ll go back in the cave and sleep for about three
days. Do you think you can find your detective
friend in that time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In three days?&rdquo; laughed Jack. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be
able to send you back to father in less time with
a full report as to what is doing in the mountains.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; Gilroy said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<p>He turned toward the barricaded cave but
halted at the very entrance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was it you said,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;about
the boy who warned you in the thicket being a
Boy Scout?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He answered the challenge all right,&rdquo; replied
Frank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he really is a Boy Scout,&rdquo; asked Gilroy
tentatively, &ldquo;he ought to be loyal to his comrades,
don&rsquo;t you think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he ought to be,&rdquo; Jack answered, &ldquo;but
then, you know, there are renegades in all
grades and ranks of society. Still, this boy may
have been acting under compulsion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have read a great deal about Boy Scouts
being loyal to each other,&rdquo; Gilroy continued,
&ldquo;and I can&rsquo;t help thinking that this one will
in time do something to make amends for his
seemingly hostile act in delivering a fraudulent
note. I have faith in the Boy Scout league!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so have we all of us!&rdquo; declared Jack.
&ldquo;We have found Boy Scouts in all parts of the
world, and we have always found them loyal and
trustworthy. This lad may yet prove to be
so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; Jimmie interrupted, &ldquo;he did show
that he was made of the right kind of stuff when
he took the pains to follow us into the forest
and advise us to get out of the country.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Jack laughed, &ldquo;but he returned from
that excursion and delivered a lying note to
Ned. Still,&rdquo; the boy went on more mildly, &ldquo;we
don&rsquo;t know anything about the circumstances
surrounding the matter, so we&rsquo;ll give him the
benefit of every doubt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I only made the suggestion,&rdquo; Gilroy advised,
&ldquo;in order that you boys might be looking for
some indication of friendliness on the part of
this seeming enemy. The boy may be of great
use to you yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a mystery to me how they ever got a
true Boy Scout mixed up in a dirty game!&rdquo;
Harry declared. &ldquo;This boy is no easy mark.
The language he used said &lsquo;New York&rsquo; just as
plain as anything, so they must have brought
him clear from the big city for some purpose of
their own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Gilroy said in a moment, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve given
you the best advice I have at my command, and
made what I regard as a valuable suggestion,&rdquo;
he continued with a laugh, &ldquo;and now I&rsquo;ll go to
bed and dream that I&rsquo;m back in New York
sleeping on top of the Singer building.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Singer building ain&rsquo;t nothing to this,&rdquo;
Harry grinned, sweeping his hand over the
great stretch of country to the east. &ldquo;From the
top of the Singer building you can&rsquo;t see the back
yard of half a dozen states.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<p>Gilroy passed through the narrow opening and
the four boys gathered about the fire to lay plans
for the future.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, whatever we do,&rdquo; Frank suggested,
&ldquo;we must never leave this cave unprotected.
Just as long as we have a bullet proof place to
hide away in, and plenty of provisions, they
can&rsquo;t drive us out of the mountains with anything
less than a piece of artillery. They know
exactly where to find us, so we won&rsquo;t have to go
chasing through the woods looking for them!&rdquo;
he added with a grin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;ll help some!&rdquo; Harry laughed, &ldquo;especially
when we want to sleep and have to set
up to dodge bullets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There ain&rsquo;t going to be no bullets!&rdquo; laughed
Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; Jimmie suggested, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to
take a little stroll for my health. I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;m
not getting sufficient exercise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before we turn him loose in the mountains,&rdquo;
Jack laughed, &ldquo;we ought to tie a bell on him.
Jimmie has a way of getting lost that approaches
the artistic. I believe he&rsquo;d get lost in a hall
bedroom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I&rsquo;d better go with him,&rdquo; Harry
ventured.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<p>&ldquo;No you won&rsquo;t!&rdquo; Jimmie said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going
out alone, and I&rsquo;m going to c-r-e-e-p and
c-r-e-e-p and c-r-e-e-p through the bushes like
one of J. Fennimore Cooper&rsquo;s foresters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Robin Hood would have been stuck on you!&rdquo;
grinned Frank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You bet he would!&rdquo; Jimmie insisted gravely.
&ldquo;Me and Robin Hood would have had some
great times together in Lincoln forest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on, then, you little runt!&rdquo; Jack exclaimed.
&ldquo;Go on and get back as soon as
possible, for we&rsquo;re all anxious to get on the hunt
for Ned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jimmie laughed and disappeared in the pines
lower down on the slope. He walked steadily
to the east and north for, perhaps, half an hour
and then began a series of operations which even
his friends might not have understood at the beginning.</p>
<p>Stopping at the foot of a granite finger which
thrust a broad surface half way up to the tops
of the pines, he began gathering dry boughs.
After a great heap had been secured, he carried
them with great exertion to the top of the
elevation. It was necessary for him to make
several trips up and down the steep side of the
rock but at last two great heaps of perfectly dry
boughs lay on the hard surface of the cliff.</p>
<p>One more trip to the bottom he made, to
return with a great back load of green pine
boughs. Then he sat down, panting, and regarded
his work with no little satisfaction.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he mused, wiping the
perspiration from his forehead, &ldquo;but I ought to
climb one of these trees. I&rsquo;d do it, too, only
I&rsquo;m afraid I couldn&rsquo;t get the fires into line on the
boughs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He heaped the dry boughs into neat, compact
array and then covered them heavily with the
green branches. This done, he set fire to each
of the two piles and sat down to await results.</p>
<p>The flames ate fast into the dry faggots and
the green boughs above made such a white
smudge as had rarely been seen in that vicinity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There,&rdquo; the boy mused, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s two towering
columns of smoke! In Indian talk, they
mean &lsquo;I want some one to come and help me
out of a mess,&rsquo; and that is what the two smudges
say in Boy Scout language, too. Now I wonder
if anyone save the lads at the camp will see and
understand. I hope the kids at the cave will
recognize this as an invitation to the bearer of
the note alone, and not directed to themselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two columns of smoke ascended straight
into the sky for perhaps ten minutes and then
died down. Jimmie sat at the top of the rock
and waited. The forest around him seemed
alive with creeping and flying things, and
sunshine filtered softly through the branches of
the great pines. After a time he climbed to the
top of a great tree and looked over the landscape.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">50</div>
<p>To the south and west he saw the faint column
of smoke lifting from the campfire. To the
north and west mountain peaks lifted above the
range, many of them white with snow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; the boy mused, &ldquo;unless the messenger
is shut up, or tied up, or rendered motionless
by the muzzle of a gun, I ought to know before
very long whether he is a good Boy Scout or
a renegade.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER V</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE CALL OF THE PACK</span></h2>
<p>From his high perch in the tree Jimmie could
see far above the timber line and clearly distinguish
slopes, ledges and precipitous canyons
invisible as a whole to one walking on the surface,
or even one looking down from a high cliff
on the mountains themselves. To the north a
snow-covered summit glistened in the sun, the
great white cloak unbroken at the top but showing
bare spaces farther down.</p>
<p>Looking in wonder and awe at this magnificent
manifestation of nature, Jimmie began to
realize, dimly, that the lines of snow on the lower
stretches of the mountain seemed to lie at one
point parallel with each other. It was as if
trenches had been dug in the form of a parallelogram
and the excavations filled in with snow.</p>
<p>The outline was so distinct that the boy regarded
it curiously for a long time. It seemed
to him that the hand of the Snow King had
sketched on the mountainside a plan for a
structure which had never been built.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<p>Just above the spot where this remarkable
pattern lay was a precipice fifty or more feet in
height. This wall seemed to the boy to be
absolutely vertical. There was a shelf of rock
below the strange snow-line, and beneath that
the heavy slope of the range.</p>
<p>Turning his eyes at last from the snow-covered
summits, the boy gazed eagerly over the forest
to left and right, studying the landscape for
some indication of a signal. Directly he saw the
column of smoke arising from the campfire
strengthening into a black mass, and knew that
the boys were answering his call not knowing by
whom it had been sent forth. He smiled
whimsically as he turned his eyes away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That tells me where the camp is, anyway!&rdquo;
he laughed.</p>
<p>Five minutes later, just as the boy was about
to descend from his tree, he caught sight of the
signal for which he had been waiting. Two
columns of smoke arose from a point on the
timber line near strange snow formation which
he had been considering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s our Boy Scout!&rdquo; he declared,
scrambling quickly to the ground.</p>
<p>Once out of the tree, the boy made no haste
in approaching the spot from which the signal
had come. Instead of proceeding in a direct
line he turned down the slope and walked
swiftly to the north.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<p>Half an hour&rsquo;s steady traveling brought him
to a point almost directly east of the columns
of smoke. He could not see the smoke at all
now, but knew of its location by the snow-capped
cliff almost in front of which it had lifted. After
reaching this point he walked directly west.</p>
<p>It was no easy matter, climbing the rugged
side of the mountain, but the boy persisted in
his work until at last he came to a shelf of rock
which seemed to be not far away from where
the signals had been shown. Stopping to rest,
he looked toward the camp for some indication
of further activity in the way of signals there
but none came.</p>
<p>The campfire itself, and the face of rock into
which the cave had long ago been cut, were not
in sight from the point where he stood, the
timber line creeping up in the form of an inverted
&ldquo;V&rdquo; and shutting out all that portion
of the lower level to the south.</p>
<p>Just as the boy was about to proceed, the long,
snarling, vicious call of a wolf came from a
thicket not far away. The boy involuntarily
drew his automatic revolver and stepped behind
the bole of a giant pine.</p>
<p>In a moment the call came again and again.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<p>There was a note in it which seemed to the
boy to speak of human lips. While he listened
another call&mdash;louder, longer, more insistent&mdash;came&mdash;the
call of the pack! Jimmie almost
danced in his excitement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Wolf Patrol!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;The good
old Wolf Patrol!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Throwing back his head he produced an excellent
imitation of the challenge he had heard.
It echoed through the forest singly for a moment
and was then joined by the call which had attracted
his attention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother of Moses!&rdquo; the boy cried. &ldquo;The
people will think there&rsquo;s a whole pack of timber
wolves in the country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Advancing now through the thicket, the boy
soon saw a motion in the underbrush not far
away. He stood still and waited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Wolf!&rdquo; he shouted in a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Wolf!&rdquo; came the answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Show your colors!&rdquo; Jimmie called.</p>
<p>In a moment a slender, dusky boy advanced
out of the thicket and approached Jimmie, his
right hand extended palm out, thumb and little
finger crossed&mdash;the full sign of the Boy Scout.</p>
<p>Jimmie sat flat down on the ground his back
against a tree trunk and regarded the lad
quizzically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You the kid that brought that note?&rdquo; he
asked.</p>
<p>The other nodded, and Jimmie went on with
a mock air of censure.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;d you do it for?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw, what&rsquo;s all this?&rdquo; said the other scornfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The third degree,&rdquo; Jimmie grinned.
&ldquo;What&rsquo;d you bring that note for? Now you&rsquo;ve
gone and got Ned Nestor into trouble. What&rsquo;s
your name?&rdquo; he continued as the boy bent his
face to the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Norman,&rdquo; was the reply, &ldquo;Wolf Patrol, New
York.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a new one on me!&rdquo; asserted Jimmie.
&ldquo;I belong to the Wolf Patrol, New York. Never
saw you before!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re Jimmie McGraw?&rdquo; Norman asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On account of your nerve!&rdquo; Norman answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;re you going to do about it?&rdquo; asked
Jimmie belligerently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been ordered,&rdquo; Norman went on with a
smile, &ldquo;to break you in two if I came across you
in the mountains.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do it, then!&rdquo; shouted Jimmie. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve
gone and got Ned into a mess, and I&rsquo;d just like
to have you try something on me now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Instead of showing temper, Norman sat down
on the ground and laughed until he felt obliged
to hold his sides.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;d you ever get away out here in the
mountains?&rdquo; Jimmie asked. &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t you afraid
you&rsquo;ll get lost?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t got lost yet!&rdquo; was the scornful
reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come now,&rdquo; Jimmie said, in a more conciliating
tone of voice, &ldquo;put me wise to the game
you&rsquo;re playing with Nestor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All I know about it is that I delivered the
note.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is Nestor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I left him talking with a very fine gentleman
who seemed to be offering to do the square thing
with him,&rdquo; was the reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bribing him, was he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about that. He was offering
him money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When will Nestor return to camp?&rdquo; asked
Jimmie.</p>
<p>Norman shook his head gravely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean that they won&rsquo;t let him go?&rdquo;
demanded the boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know anything about it,&rdquo; Norman
answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who told you to rope Ned into such a mess?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The man I work for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s his name?&rdquo; asked Jimmie then.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His name is Toombs,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;He
hired me to come out on a hunting trip with
him and help around the camp.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">57</div>
<p>&ldquo;How many are there in the party?&rdquo; was
Jimmie&rsquo;s next question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only two, Toombs and a black looking
heathen named Huga. I guess he&rsquo;s an Indian.
Anyway, he&rsquo;s a mighty evil-looking fellow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Jimmie announced accusingly, &ldquo;those
fellows are not out here on a hunting trip at all!
They&rsquo;re out here to make trouble for Ned Nestor
and his friends. I think you&rsquo;ve done a mighty
cute trick in helping them along with their
work!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say,&rdquo; Norman answered, with a touch of
irony in his voice, &ldquo;you go away in some quiet
spot and count yourself. When you get done
you&rsquo;ll find you aren&rsquo;t so many. You needn&rsquo;t
think you&rsquo;re the only boy that can get a job in
the mountains.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has Toombs captured any game yet?&rdquo;
asked Jimmie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t seen him do any hunting,&rdquo; was the
answer. &ldquo;He and Huga just sit around in camp
all day and send half-breed messengers scurrying
around from place to place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So there are half-breed messengers, are
there?&rdquo; demanded Jimmie. &ldquo;You said there
were only two&mdash;Toombs and Huga.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<p>&ldquo;I left New York with Toombs and Huga,&rdquo;
answered Norman, &ldquo;and they&rsquo;re the only ones
I have anything to do with. The half-breeds
we found here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; Jimmie said with a smile, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve
got Toombs&rsquo; number right now. If he butts
in on us again, we&rsquo;ll roll him down to the foothills.
What does he want of Ned, anyway?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How should I know?&rdquo; demanded Norman.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not his confidential secretary! Say, I&rsquo;d
like to go and live with you boys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Jimmie promised, &ldquo;you go to Toombs
and stay with him until you get Ned out of the
mess you got him into, and you can come and
live with us, all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys sat together under a scraggly pine
for a long time, talking about New York and the
Wolf Patrol. Norman had joined the Wolves
during Jimmie&rsquo;s absence, and so they had not
chanced to meet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Norman said directly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to
be getting back to camp. They expect me to
build the fire and get the meals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is the camp?&rdquo; asked Jimmie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s on a shelf not far off,&rdquo; was the reply.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not to tell anybody where it is, but you
can find it for yourself if you care to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I care to?&rdquo; repeated Jimmie. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
you suppose I&rsquo;m going there and help Ned out
of the trouble you got him into?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<p>&ldquo;Go as far as you like,&rdquo; Norman replied,
&ldquo;only I advise you to keep away from there.
Those men are dangerous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then will you help Ned away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do what I can,&rdquo; answered Norman
gravely. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you, just now, all about
the situation I&rsquo;m in, but you&rsquo;ll probably know
sometime that I didn&rsquo;t play crooked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to tag along when you go back to
camp!&rdquo; warned Jimmie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then keep a long ways behind,&rdquo; Norman
replied. &ldquo;When I get to the top of that little
elevation over there,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make the
Wolf call again and you come along. Only,&rdquo;
he continued, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t try to get into the camp
alone. There&rsquo;s a whole regiment of half-breeds
sneaking around. Perhaps some of them have
followed me here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Norman disappeared in the undergrowth, and
Jimmie sat waiting for the signal agreed upon.
He waited a long time but no signal came.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I wonder,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;if that Boy
Scout was acting on the level. I wonder if he
won&rsquo;t give me away to that man Toombs and
his bunch of half-breeds. I believe he&rsquo;s crooked
after all! Think I&rsquo;ll sneak.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<p>He arose from his position by the tree and
turned toward the camp. He had proceeded
but a short distance, however, when he tripped
and fell over a running vine. Before he could
regain his feet he was seized by two pair of
muscular hands and laid flat on his back. A
knife large enough to cut a hole in the side of a
house was held to his throat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you, Norman,&rdquo; he said under his breath,
&ldquo;if I just had that scrawny neck of yours in
my hands now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy&rsquo;s rage against the one who had apparently
betrayed him was so overpowering that
for a moment he paid little attention to the two
half-breeds bent over him. Then he saw that
the vine over which he had fallen had been purposely
held in front of his feet.</p>
<p>His captors were dusky fellows, with straight
black, greasy hair and narrow, treacherous
black eyes. They seemed to the boy to be
crosses between Mexican and California Indians.
Directly Jimmie was hustled to his feet by a
muscular hand at his collar and his automatic
revolver, searchlight and even his pocket knife
taken from him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say,&rdquo; Jimmie said, &ldquo;if I had one of you
fellows on the Bowery, somewhere down near
Stanton street, I wouldn&rsquo;t do a thing to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You bright boy!&rdquo; grunted one of the half-breeds
as the two started away with their
prisoner. &ldquo;You ver&rsquo; bright boy!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
<p>They did not take the precaution to bind the
boy in any way, but they gave no chance of
escape, for every step of the way muscular hands
clung to him. The way was rough, for it led
directly up the slope, and this mode of surveillance
was rather helpful than otherwise in the
steep climb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say,&rdquo; Jimmie demanded after a long walk,
&ldquo;did that kid who talked with me tell you to
follow him and get me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You one fool boy!&rdquo; declared one of his
captors. &ldquo;You have your eyes in the wool!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">62</div>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER VI</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">A BRIBE OF HALF A MILLION</span></h2>
<p>Preceded by the boy who had brought the
note, Ned walked swiftly along the side of the
mountain for a mile or more, taking a northerly
course. It is needless to say that the boy was
more than suspicious regarding the authenticity
of the message he had received.</p>
<p>In the first place, the handwriting on the piece
of paper was not at all like that of either of the
boys who were alleged to have sent it. In the
second place, the boys were never known to
carry writing paper with them on their trips
out from the camp.</p>
<p>There was a chance, however, that either
Jimmie or Frank had written the message at a
moment of peril or during great excitement.
There was a bare chance, too, that one of them
had discovered a sheet of writing paper in his
pocket.</p>
<p>The appeal for help, suspicious as it was, was
by no means to be disregarded, so Ned trudged
along behind his guide, feeling that whatever
took place he was doing his full duty.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<p>And there was another feature of the case
which Ned considered fully. Should the sending
of the message prove to be a trick on the
part of some designing person, it was quite important
that he should know who that person
was. His decision to follow the boy, therefore,
was brought about by these two reasons.</p>
<p>It will be remembered that up to the time of
Ned&rsquo;s departure from camp, no suspicion of any
hostile presence in the mountains had been
entertained. Gilroy, the fat, confidential clerk,
it will be remembered, arrived shortly after
Ned&rsquo;s departure in response to the message.</p>
<p>Realizing that the messenger might be leading
him into a trap, Ned took occasion to blaze
his trail by marks on trees, carelessly made, by
signs in twigs and by signs in stones. All
these, he knew, would be readily understood by
anyone of his chums, or, in fact, by any Boy
Scout.</p>
<p>Once or twice Ned thought he caught in the
eye of his guide a significant look as these signs
were left in the path. However, the boy made
no objections to Ned&rsquo;s frequent pauses, and gave
no indications of displeasure at the marking of
the trail.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<p>After a long walk along the slope of the
mountain toward the north, the boy suddenly
turned straight west and made his way up toward
the snow line. Here the walking was very
difficult, as the boys were obliged to wind around
jutting crags and climb into and out of narrow
canyons at the bottoms of which trickles of
water made their way eastward.</p>
<p>Up to this time very little conversation had
been indulged in, but now during the frequent
necessary halts, Ned began questioning his
strange companion. The boy answered in a
manner which at first seemed entirely frank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you like the bread and beans?&rdquo;
Ned asked at one resting place with a smile.
&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you wake us up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you talking about bread and
beans?&rdquo; asked the boy, though the sly look in
his face told Ned that he understood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The next time you come to our camp in the
night,&rdquo; Ned went on, &ldquo;Just wake us up and
we&rsquo;ll give you a night lunch worth while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about last night?&rdquo; asked the boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Last night,&rdquo; Ned answered, &ldquo;you would
have had broiled bear steak and hot coffee.
Steak beats cold beans, doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, you are a good fellow!&rdquo; exclaimed the
guide.</p>
<p>Ned laughingly extended his right hand, giving
the full Boy Scout salute. The guide returned
the sign and asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you know?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<p>&ldquo;The button under the lapel of your coat
shows when you are climbing,&rdquo; Ned replied.
&ldquo;Why do you try to hide it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I put it there so it wouldn&rsquo;t get lost,&rdquo; was
the hesitating answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What time did you reach our camp last
night?&rdquo; was Ned&rsquo;s next question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A little after twelve,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
a wonder you fellows wouldn&rsquo;t keep some one
on watch. The bears&rsquo;ll eat you up some
night!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did you come to the camp at all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I was wandering over the mountains
when you boys came in late yesterday afternoon,
and I thought I would go over and have a
visit with you. After I got to your camp I
thought perhaps you wouldn&rsquo;t like to be routed
out of bed, so I just helped myself to a lunch
and came away. Say, but I was good and
hungry!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you doing in the mountains?&rdquo;
asked Ned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I came in with hunters from New York,&rdquo;
was the answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you live in New York city, do you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; was the slow reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And belong to the Wolf Patrol, your button
says!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I belong to the Wolf Patrol.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<p>&ldquo;Where are you taking me now?&rdquo; asked Ned,
at another stop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, to the place where the boys are,&rdquo; was
the reply.</p>
<p>At that moment Ned understood that the
guide was not telling the truth. There was a
look in the fellow&rsquo;s eyes which betrayed the fact.
However, he decided to continue the journey
and discover if possible why the fraudulent
message had been sent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who gave you this message?&rdquo; he finally
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The man who saw the boys,&rdquo; was the answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you did not see the boys?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; was the slow reply, &ldquo;I saw the boys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you speak with them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I spoke with them,&rdquo; replied the guide.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did they give you this note? If so, tell me
under what circumstances it was written. It
says that they are in need of assistance. Tell
me the exact situation of affairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Instead of replying to the direct question, the
guide darted away, passing around a corner of
rock, and was soon lost to view. Ned hesitated,
not knowing whether he ought to follow
him or not.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
<p>While he stood considering the matter, four
as evil-looking half-breeds as he had ever seen
swarmed down upon him, and in a moment he
was bound hand and foot and placed on a rude
stretcher.</p>
<p>The attack had come so suddenly that the
boy had offered little resistance. He now lay
upon the stretcher of bark and boughs and
looked into the faces of his captors with curiosity
as well as astonishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you do that for?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>The individual who seemed to be the leader
of the party mumbled out some sullen reply
and motioned to the others to take up the litter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyway,&rdquo; the boy said grimly, &ldquo;I seem to
be going in state.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a slippery cuss!&rdquo; the leader declared
and the little procession moved on up the
slope.</p>
<p>All four of the men seemed to be half-breeds,
dirty and roughly clad. Ned felt a feeling of
repulsion which would have been expressed by
blows had his feet and hands been at liberty.</p>
<p>The climb up the mountain was a slow one,
and one not at all pleasant to the boy as they
insisted on carrying him feet foremost. At last,
however, they came to a level shelf of fair size
whereon a tent had been pitched.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">68</div>
<p>There was a fire in front of the tent, and a
large, fleshy, well-dressed man sat on a packing
box industriously whittling a pine stick. Not
far away, and bent over a mass of dirty dishes,
was a man who seemed to be older and a great
deal taller than the man on the box.</p>
<p>This latter individual&rsquo;s face was thin and dark
and lighted by a pair of eyes which seemed almost
lidless, like those of a snake. Both men
were very neatly dressed in tailor-made garments
although the articles of clothing showed the
effects of mountain climbing.</p>
<p>The litter was set down in front of the tent
and Ned lost no time in taking a sitting position.
The fat man looked him over benevolently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, son,&rdquo; he said in a moment, &ldquo;you made
no effort to make my acquaintance, and so I
sent the boys to ask you over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They did it all right!&rdquo; Ned answered.</p>
<p>The fat man now motioned to the half-breeds,
who proceeded to search the boy for
weapons and then cut his bonds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said the fat man, &ldquo;we may as well
introduce ourselves. You are Ned Nestor, I
take it? Well, my name is Richard Toombs,
recently of the city of New York.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you happen to escape?&rdquo; asked Ned
scornfully.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">69</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now don&rsquo;t make the mistake of becoming
sarcastic!&rdquo; Toombs warned. &ldquo;I had you brought
here because I can do you a service and you can
do me one. We&rsquo;ll get along all right together if
you exercise the good sense you are generally
given credit for possessing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you wanted to see me,&rdquo; Ned demanded
angrily, &ldquo;why didn&rsquo;t you come over to the
camp? Why did you send your cut-throats
over to tie me up like a pig for roasting?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; Toombs answered, &ldquo;you have the
reputation in New York of being a very obstinate
as well as a very clever lad. Because,
again,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;I have no time to waste
in preliminaries. I wanted you to understand
from the word &lsquo;Go&rsquo; just exactly what the situation
is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what is it?&rdquo; asked Ned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You came into the mountains with young
Jack Bosworth?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jack is a member of my party,&rdquo; Ned answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you came on a mission for Jack&rsquo;s
father?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing of the kind!&rdquo; answered Ned. &ldquo;We
came in on a vacation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t expect me to believe that, do
you?&rdquo; demanded Toombs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the truth,&rdquo; answered Ned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is remarkable,&rdquo; smiled Toombs, &ldquo;that
Jack Bosworth&rsquo;s son and you, a juvenile detective
of pronounced ability, should just happen
into this country at this particular time!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">70</div>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think we came in for?&rdquo; asked
Ned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Young man,&rdquo; Toombs answered, &ldquo;a good
many million dollars depend upon the finding of
certain records. I, representing various claimants,
am informed that Jack Bosworth, Senior,
the scheming corporation lawyer, has definite
information concerning the whereabouts of those
papers. It is my belief that you came here to
seize and destroy them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Ned said with a smile, &ldquo;if you believe
that, you certainly have acted unwisely. It
strikes me that the correct thing for you to
have done was to have waited until I secured
the papers before you declared yourself my
enemy. Can&rsquo;t you see that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I can&rsquo;t!&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;The papers
would not last five minutes after coming into
your hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you,&rdquo; Ned replied lightly, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
know anything about the papers of which you
speak. We came here on a vacation, and that
is all there is to it. You have made a mistake,
and my advice to you is to rectify it at the
earliest possible moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Toombs said, &ldquo;if you insist on sticking
to a lie like that, I can&rsquo;t help it. I&rsquo;ll give
you fair warning, however, that you must consider
yourself my guest until I get an entirely
different answer from you. I hope we&rsquo;ll get
along well together. You&rsquo;ll be well treated.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">71</div>
<p>Ned turned his eyes away from the broad,
fat, smooth face of Toombs to catch a glimpse
of the boy messenger standing at a corner of the
tent. It seemed to Ned for an instant that the
boy was about to communicate with him by sign
or word. Then his face changed into one of
sullen defiance and he passed from view.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is that boy?&rdquo; asked Ned. &ldquo;The messenger
who brought the note, I mean? Did he
write the note himself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered Toombs, &ldquo;I wrote the note.
We were together&mdash;the boy and I&mdash;on the slope
below your camp, and he caught sight of two of
your chums. Then it occurred to me to send
for you in the name of the boys. He only delivered
the note&mdash;I wrote it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a wonder you didn&rsquo;t send your half-breeds
out after the boys, too,&rdquo; Ned said. &ldquo;You
might have lugged them away easily enough, I
presume.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, see here,&rdquo; Toombs went on, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
want any trouble with your friends or with you.
I&rsquo;ll make you a fair business proposition. Tell
me the plans of this tricky corporation lawyer
you are serving; tell me where to find the papers
you came here in trace of, and I&rsquo;ll give you half
a million dollars. Now,&rdquo; the fat man went on,
&ldquo;perhaps you will understand why I did not
molest any of your chums and why no harm
came to any of you when my men were at your
camp at midnight.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">72</div>
<p>&ldquo;And if I refuse to accept this monstrous
bribe?&rdquo; Ned asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then no one will ever know that the offer
was made or refused,&rdquo; declared Toombs with
an evil gleam in his eyes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER VII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE FRANCISCAN MISSION</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Now, I wonder,&rdquo; Jimmie mused as he was
forced along by the two half-breeds, &ldquo;whether I
won&rsquo;t get a chance before long to show these
ginks how fast I can run. I sure could do something
of a stunt on my feet if I had an opportunity
right now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During one of the brief breathing spells, when
the half-breeds paused for an instant on a level
ledge of rock, the boy turned to the east and
faced the pines in the vicinity of which he had
been captured. In the distance he could see
the granite finger sticking up like a mile-post in
the green of the trees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Judging from the course we have taken, and
the distance we have traveled,&rdquo; the boy mused,
&ldquo;we ought to be somewhere in the vicinity of
the parallelogram I saw in the snow. Only,&rdquo;
he added ruefully, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s quite a climb up to that
point yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was thinking of the story Gilroy had told
of the ruined mission; of the walls in ruins, and
the subterranean rooms and passages farther
back in the heart of the hill.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">74</div>
<p>&ldquo;It would just be my luck,&rdquo; he mused grimly,
&ldquo;to discover that ruined mission, and lead the
way into the basement of that old peak. If I
get a chance to break away from these half-breeds,
I&rsquo;ll make a run in that direction anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From that time on the boy pretended great
fatigue. He insisted on frequent rests, and
always lay down panting whenever his captors
halted in their clumsy ascent of the slope. The
half-breeds regarded the boy with scornful
glances at such times, as if expressing contempt
for one unable to endure an ordinary journey up
a mountainside.</p>
<p>The boy was perfectly willing that they
should believe him to be exhausted by his
efforts. When, after a few short rests, they
dropped their hands away from his arms, he
experienced a thrill of hope.</p>
<p>At last his opportunity came. The half-breeds
became less watchful as time passed on.
They even turned their snaky eyes away from
him at times, looking over the valley below and
conversing together in a language he could not
understand.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">75</div>
<p>Watching his opportunity, when their eyes
were directed in another direction, the boy
sprang away and ran as nimbly as a mountain
goat up the acclivity. The half-breeds were so
astonished at the sudden action of the boy; so
utterly bewildered by the speed he made, that
for a moment they made no effort to stop him.</p>
<p>When at last they sprang after him, threatening
to shoot if he did not halt instantly, it was
too late. Jimmie passed around a ledge of rock
and was soon out of their sight.</p>
<p>The remainder of that race for freedom always
came back to the boy&rsquo;s mind as a bit of nightmare.
He ran swiftly along ledges, bounded
over boulders, dipped breathlessly into gulches,
and clung to precipitous sides with his bare fingers
until it seemed that he must drop from sheer
exhaustion. At last he came to a canyon wider
and deeper than any which he had yet encountered.</p>
<p>He scrambled down the slope, always pursued
by fragments of rocks from above, and
presently landed a hundred feet below on a
shelf which seemed to promise temporary safety.
Panting and trembling from the exertion, came
in every limb, he listened for sounds of pursuit
but none came to his ears.</p>
<p>Sitting on the narrow ledge, his back against
an almost vertical wall, he realized that he had
climbed to a great distance, for he shivered in
his warm clothing and the sharp sting of frosty
air was in his nostrils. Without knowing it, he
had actually entered the region of snow.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">76</div>
<p>After a time composure came back with his
breath, and he began looking around in the hope
of finding some way out which did not lead in
the direction his pursuers were probably taking.
Then his attention was attracted to the
shelf upon which he sat.</p>
<p>It seemed to him that at some time in the
distant past crude steps had been cut in the
ledge and along the wall leading into the gorge
below. Melting snows and the storms of many
winters had, in a measure, obliterated the sharp
outlines of the treads, but still the boy saw the
work of man in the arrangement.</p>
<p>After a time he arose lamely to his feet and
walked along in the direction pointed out by the
crude stairway. Directly he came to an opening
in the wall of the precipice.</p>
<p>Realizing that the cave would at least serve
as a hiding place, the boy entered and looked
about. The place was dark and damp. A flock
of bats, stirred into activity by his approach,
flew in his face and winged their way toward the
brilliant sunshine beyond.</p>
<p>Jimmie would have given a good deal just at
that time for one of the dozen or more searchlights
which lay at the camp. There was no
knowing how far the passage extended into the
mountain, and it was very dark.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">77</div>
<p>For all he knew it might be intersected by
passages worn away by subterranean streams.
Presently he remembered that a good supply of
matches which he had acquired that morning
had not been taken away from him. Lighting
one, he saw that the floor of the passage was
remarkably smooth and free from obstructions.
The walls were also smooth, and held, here and
there, shallow openings which seemed to have
been artificially produced. As he proceeded
through the tunnel-like place he became aware
of a damp chill wind blowing directly upon him.</p>
<p>As the passage narrowed, the current of air
became stronger, and before long the boy found
it impossible to use matches without wasting
them. Presently he found that by extending
his arms he could touch the walls on either side.
The stones were, of course, damp and loathsome
to the touch.</p>
<p>Only for a remarkable discovery made through
the medium of his fingers, he might then have
abandoned further investigation of the grewsome
place. His discovery was this:</p>
<p>The passage through which he was moving
was of artificial construction!</p>
<p>The walls showed traces of rude chisel work!</p>
<p>After a time the walls drew back so that he
was unable to reach them even by taking a few
steps to right and left. It seemed, too, that
he had passed out of the current of air.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">78</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s dollars to rotten apples,&rdquo; mused the
boy, exultant though anxious, &ldquo;that I have
blundered into some old-time robber den, or
into the subterranean rooms of the old Franciscan
mission.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The thought was exhilarating, and the boy
notwithstanding the peril in which he believed
himself to be, danced gaily about for a moment.
As he did so, one foot slipped over the edge of a
declivity and he went rolling down, down, in
the darkness to a lower level.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whoever built this idiotic contraption,&rdquo; the
boy declared, feeling of his arms and legs to see
if they were still whole, &ldquo;neglected to put in
elevators, but I found a way to get down stairs,
all the same!&rdquo;</p>
<p>While the boy sat on the rocky floor rubbing
the bruised knee upon which he had fallen, a
ray of light shone upon a wall directly in front
of him. He turned quickly about and saw the
round eye of a searchlight fixed upon the ceiling.</p>
<p>He crouched closer to the floor and waited.
It seemed to him that the person in charge of
the light must have seen him. Still he hoped
that such was not the case. The light advanced
nearer to where he sat and so he crawled stealthily
away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">79</div>
<p>&ldquo;I am a child of fortune, sure enough!&rdquo;
chuckled the boy after the immediate danger of
discovery had passed. &ldquo;First thing I know, I&rsquo;ll
find a banquet room in here with a table loaded
down with haunches of venison and great
tankards of nut-brown ale.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While the boy crouched in the corner the
light passed him and turned into a passage leading
to the east. Then he heard the sound of
voices&mdash;low, fierce voices, speaking in English.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you let him escape!&rdquo; one said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you he rose up in the air and flew like
a bird!&rdquo; another voice exclaimed. &ldquo;No living
person ever saw such an exhibition before!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But still, you let him escape!&rdquo; the first
speaker repeated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He only got away!&rdquo; was the answer. &ldquo;He
is somewhere in this vicinity and we&rsquo;ll get him
before nightfall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As well look for a diamond in the bottom of
the Atlantic!&rdquo; snarled the other. &ldquo;I have sent
the men out in the search, but have no hope
of their getting hold of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s me!&rdquo; mused Jimmie. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s me
they&rsquo;re talking about trying to get hold of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we may as well go back to camp,&rdquo;
said the first speaker. &ldquo;There is no profit in
arguing here.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">80</div>
<p>Jimmie crept forward toward the light and
saw a large, fat, smooth-faced man and a tall
man with a thin face standing in a narrow
chamber which seemed to have been fairly well
furnished once, but which now held only decaying
tables, chairs and couches. It was the tall,
dark man who held the light. As Jimmie
looked, he laid it down on a tottering table to
make and light a cigarette.</p>
<p>His mind busy with a daring thought, Jimmie
crept into the chamber and watched for the
opportunity he sought. The men were talking
together in lower tones now, and seemed to be
very much interested in the subject under discussion.
As they spoke, they both walked
excitedly up and down the little chamber,
brushing against the decaying articles of furniture
whenever they by chance left the pathway
shown by the light.</p>
<p>Jimmie advanced toward the table and finally
succeeded in crawling under it. Then, waiting
until they were at the farther end of their
promenade, at the extreme distance from the
lamp, he reached cautiously out and switched
off the light.</p>
<p>In the darkness which followed he gave the
table a slight push and sent it clattering to the
floor and, with the light in his possession, darted
out in the direction of the passage by which he
had entered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">81</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now, we&rsquo;ll have a job finding that electric!&rdquo;
one of the men said angrily. &ldquo;Light a match,
will you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have just used my last match,&rdquo; was the
discouraging reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I never carry matches,&rdquo; the first
speaker said, &ldquo;but we ought to be able to find
the electric easily enough in the darkness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Strange what made it go out,&rdquo; one said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you hear the table fall?&rdquo; demanded
the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I remember now,&rdquo; was the answer. &ldquo;The
lamp is probably broken, so we may as well find
our way out without looking for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have my permission to do that,&rdquo;
chuckled Jimmie from his now secure hiding
place.</p>
<p>The two men stumbled about in the darkness
for a minute, and the boy knew that they were
feeling their way to some entrance other than
the one by which he had found his way into the
cave. Before long their footsteps and their
voices died away, and then he advanced into
the little chamber where they had stood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The old mission, all right!&rdquo; he thought.</p>
<p>While he looked around other footsteps were
heard, followed by the sound of a struggle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold fast!&rdquo; some one shouted.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">82</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hold fast yourself!&rdquo; was the smothered
reply. &ldquo;What do you mean by letting go of the
fellow in that way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t let go. I&rsquo;ve got hold of him yet!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you fool!&rdquo; shouted the other. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
my arm you&rsquo;ve got hold of! Where&rsquo;s your
light?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dropped it in the fight,&rdquo; was the answer.
&ldquo;Go on away and get one. He&rsquo;s somewhere in
the cave, and it&rsquo;s a sure thing he can&rsquo;t get out.
Tell the boys to guard all the entrances. That
fool of a Toombs did a smart thing when he
told us we needn&rsquo;t keep him tied!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jimmie heard running footsteps for an instant
and then came silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I wonder,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;if they&rsquo;ve gone
and captured some of the boys and brought
them here. They may have the whole bunch
by this time for all I know. I wonder if I dare
turn on this light.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Instead of doing so, however, he sat perfectly
still and listened to a soft tread approaching the
spot where he stood. Whoever the visitor was,
he was short of breath for he came along panting
as if winded by a long struggle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take a chance on the light,&rdquo; he mused.</p>
<p>And the next instant the room was illuminated.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">83</div>
<h2 id="c8"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER VIII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">A QUEER HIDING PLACE</span></h2>
<p>When Jimmie turned on the searchlight in
the cavern, he half expected to see the hostile
face of one of the half-breeds. Instead, the
light revealed Ned, standing in an attitude of
defense, a stone of good size balanced in each
hand. The light went out instantly.</p>
<p>The situation was now doubly alarming, it
being well-known to the outlaws that Ned was
at liberty somewhere within the cavern. It was
certain that they would soon enter the place in
full force, with plenty of light, in which case it
seemed that both boys would surely be discovered.</p>
<p>Still, so great was the joy of the boys at the
unexpected meeting, that, in spite of the general
peril of the situation, they seized each other like
baby bears and danced madly about.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did you come from, Jimmie?&rdquo; demanded
Ned, still breathless.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I was invited to this part of the
country,&rdquo; the boy replied, &ldquo;and came in here
by accident. And so, then,&rdquo; he continued,
&ldquo;that message was a fake one after all!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">84</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it was a fake message, of course, because
you boys never sent it,&rdquo; laughed Ned,
&ldquo;but we mustn&rsquo;t stop here to explain matters,&rdquo;
he continued. &ldquo;Those fellows will be in here
thicker than bees around honey in a short time,
and we must find some way of eluding them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know the way out!&rdquo; Jimmie answered.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a long passage leading to a gorge on
the side of the mountain, and if we can get up
to that, we can slip away without any one knowing
anything about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid the outlaws know and are guarding
all the entrances,&rdquo; Ned answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if they know this one, they don&rsquo;t use
it,&rdquo; Jimmie insisted, &ldquo;because the elevator
isn&rsquo;t working, and there isn&rsquo;t any staircase, and
I came near breaking my neck tumbling down a
chute from the passage into the next room. I
believe we can make a sneak that way!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We may as well try,&rdquo; Ned agreed, &ldquo;for we
can gain nothing by remaining inactive. Turn
on your light, and we&rsquo;ll make a break for the
place where you got your tumble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it safe to turn on the light?&rdquo; asked
Jimmie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is safer now than it will be in a few
minutes,&rdquo; Ned answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the answer to that?&rdquo; demanded
Jimmie.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">85</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, the outlaws are doubtless collecting
their forces now, and in a very short time they&rsquo;ll
be rummaging every nook and corner of this
hole in the ground. We certainly can&rsquo;t show a
light after they get in here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should have known that!&rdquo; Jimmie exclaimed.
&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;m getting pretty dense,
anyhow. Say, Ned,&rdquo; the boy went on, &ldquo;is it
absolutely necessary for us to get captured,
and tied up, and imprisoned, and shut up in
some old hole, every time we go out on a vacation
trip?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t go out looking for adventures and
have things come your way all the time,&rdquo; suggested
Ned. &ldquo;Now, turn on your light,&rdquo; he
continued, &ldquo;and we&rsquo;ll make a quick break for
the passage by which you entered. The minute
you see the passage, turn out your light and we&rsquo;ll
find our way in the dark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid we&rsquo;ll need wings to get up into
the passage,&rdquo; Jimmie suggested. &ldquo;It seems to
me that I fell far enough to hit the pavement
from the top of Madison Square Garden.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, get to going!&rdquo; urged Ned. &ldquo;Get a
move on! For all we know they may be lurking
around here now.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">86</div>
<p>Jimmie switched on the light, whirled it over
the dilapidated and rotting furniture for an instant,
then shot into the next chamber, and from
that into a by-passage by way of which he had
entered. The floor of this by-passage stood at
an angle of about fifty degrees, and the boys
were preparing to undertake the climb when
shouts came from the rear, and a great light
filled the room they had just left.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can never get up there now!&rdquo; Ned
whispered. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to take a run for it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; returned Jimmie, &ldquo;we can run only
around in a circle, and there&rsquo;s enough of them
to wear us out in a few minutes. What we&rsquo;ve
got to do right now is to find a hiding place!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At great risk of discovery, Ned seized the
flashlight and pressed the spring. The illumination
showed a moldy chamber with
water dripping from the walls in places.</p>
<p>At some distant day the chamber had evidently
been occupied by human beings, for a
great fire-place was cut in the rock at one end,
and there were niches in the wall which had
doubtless been used for storage. The floor was
smooth, showing the work of human hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get onto the fire-place!&rdquo; whispered Jimmie.
&ldquo;Where do you suppose the smoke goes?
There&rsquo;s no chimney on the mountain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably it escapes through some opening
in the rock,&rdquo; Ned answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you suppose,&rdquo; Jimmie asked, &ldquo;that the
smoke vent is large enough for us to hide in?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">87</div>
<p>Before the words were out of the boy&rsquo;s mouth,
Ned was making toward the fireplace. The
light was out now, but Jimmie had no difficulty
in following the boy in the darkness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ned!&rdquo; he called softly in a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on up!&rdquo; whispered Ned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Turn on the light, then,&rdquo; Jimmie advised.</p>
<p>Ned switched on the electric, but kept it inside
the chimney into which he had climbed.
Only a faint radiance reached the opening below.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give me your hand,&rdquo; whispered Ned, &ldquo;and
I&rsquo;ll give you a lift.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sound of voices and footsteps now
echoed loudly through the cavern. Lights
were flashing here and there, and when Jimmie
at last found himself inside the chimney, he
knew that the very room he had recently left
was being occupied by the outlaws.</p>
<p>The electric light was out again, and the boy
groped with his hands in the darkness. Much
to his surprise they failed to locate his chum.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ned!&rdquo; he called softly. &ldquo;Where are you
hiding?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jimmie heard a chuckle in the darkness and
felt a hand on his shoulder. Then Ned
whispered in his ear:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">88</div>
<p>&ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;ve stumbled on one of the hidden
cells of the mission!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Anyway there&rsquo;s
a hole leading out of this chimney that&rsquo;s big
enough to keep house in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be finding a train of cars and an East
river ferryboat next,&rdquo; Jimmie chuckled. &ldquo;We
always do find something when we go away from
camp. If we don&rsquo;t find anything else, we find
trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was thought safe, now, to turn on the
electric light. The rays showed a room perhaps
twelve feet in size with furniture and furnishings
of the description of those in the chamber
below. Although the apartment seemed to be
somewhere near the center of a lofty finger of
rock which lifted from the eastern slope of the
mountain, the air was remarkably fresh and
pure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s an opening somewhere,&rdquo; Ned suggested.
&ldquo;A shut-in room like this would asphyxiate
one if there were no ventilation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I think we&rsquo;d better be finding it!&rdquo;
Jimmie advised. &ldquo;Just listen to those fellows
chewing the rag in the room we recently left!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys remained perfectly silent, then, and
listened. There seemed to be several men in
the chamber below, and two were talking in
angry tones. There were plenty of torches below,
too, for the red flare and the stink of them
came into the boys&rsquo; hiding place by way of the
fire-niche below. This is what the boys heard:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">89</div>
<p>&ldquo;You can see for yourself, Huga,&rdquo; a voice
which Ned recognized as that of Toombs, was
saying, &ldquo;that the boy is not here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I am certain I heard footsteps running
in this direction when I stood in the darkness
before you men came in!&rdquo; Huga answered.
&ldquo;He must be in this chamber somewhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look for yourself!&rdquo; Toombs advised crossly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t there some hiding place in the walls?&rdquo;
asked Huga.</p>
<p>Ned nudged Jimmie as they heard this, and
both moved farther back in the hiding place.
It will be understood how intently they listened
for the next sentence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ought to know that,&rdquo; Toombs answered;
&ldquo;you are supposed to know all about this old
mission, while I am fresh from Wall street.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have never heard of any secret passage or
room in this part of the excavation,&rdquo; the half-breed
replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then stop arguing that the boy is here!&rdquo;
roared Toombs.</p>
<p>Huga made no reply, but the boys heard him
poking about in the fireplace. Presently a
light flashed into the chimney.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s after us now all right!&rdquo; whispered
Jimmie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep still, you little dunce!&rdquo; Ned said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">90</div>
<p>&ldquo;If he sticks his head up here, soak him!&rdquo;
advised Jimmie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think I won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Ned returned.</p>
<p>But Huga did not enter the huge old fireplace
at all. When he flashed his light into the
chimney he saw only straight up, and the vertical
passage from the fire-flue was too small for
even a small cat to negotiate.</p>
<p>The chamber into which the boys had found
their way was directly at the back of the flue,
and might have been seen by a more careful
man. The boys chuckled as the half-breed
turned away.</p>
<p>In a few minutes the sounds of pursuit ceased
entirely. Lights no longer flashed about the
room, creating a faint mist in the fireplace below.
Still the boys were not certain that the
outlaws had abandoned the hunt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, Ned,&rdquo; Jimmie whispered, directly,
poking Ned in the ribs, &ldquo;you didn&rsquo;t bring one of
those bear steaks with you, did you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Jimmie,&rdquo; Ned said in pretended
amazement, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re not getting hungry, are
you? I&rsquo;m astonished at that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hungry!&rdquo; repeated the boy. &ldquo;I feel as if
I could eat my way through this rock like a
mouse eats through cheese! And I could drink
a barrel of water. There never was such a
thirst.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">91</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Ned suggested, &ldquo;we&rsquo;d better wait
here a little while, until things get quieted down,
and then make a break for the passage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; Jimmie said with an air of
resignation, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll crawl back here in the corner
and try to imagine that I&rsquo;m in charge of a pie
wagon on Third avenue. Perhaps I can dream
a pie or two!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy leaned back in an angle of the
chamber and prepared to continue the discussion
regarding the different kinds of pies sold
at the old Williams street corner. As he did so,
the support of his back gave way, his heels flew
up in the air, and he tumbled all of a heap into a
passage which seemed to begin at that corner
of the room.</p>
<p>Hearing the fall and the exclamation of impatience
which came from the boy&rsquo;s lips, Ned
turned on the electric and saw Jimmie lying on
his back in a tunnel probably a yard in size
each way. There were plenty of indications
that the tunnel had been cut through solid rock.</p>
<p>As far as Ned could see; that is, as far as the
eye of the electric carried; there were no breaks
in it. Directly a chill breeze blew in from the
opening, and the boy knew that the passage
touched the surface of the mountain not far
away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">92</div>
<p>&ldquo;Je-rusalem!&rdquo; shouted Jimmie, &ldquo;hold up
the light and let me see if I&rsquo;m all here. That&rsquo;s
the second tumble I&rsquo;ve got in this consarned old
hole today.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If every tumble you get in life brings such
results as this,&rdquo; Ned declared, &ldquo;you ought to
go around the world looking for tumbles!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They hurt, just the same!&rdquo; Jimmie declared,
rubbing the back of his head. &ldquo;I got
an awful bump on my coco!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, crowd along!&rdquo; advised Ned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Crowd along?&rdquo; repeated Jimmie. &ldquo;What
for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Use your nose,&rdquo; advised Ned.</p>
<p>Jimmie sniffed elaborately and hit Ned a
resounding whack on the back. Then he sat
down on the bottom of the passage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, Ned, look here!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;When we
got into this scrape, we didn&rsquo;t look for any old
Franciscan monks to help us out, did we? Two
or three hundred years ago, when they dug
this passage through the rock, they hadn&rsquo;t any
idea they were digging it for us, had they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a mysterious world,&rdquo; Ned answered.
&ldquo;It seems to be unnecessary for us to plan any
mode of escape. The wise old chap who formed
the Franciscan order in Europe, hundreds of
years ago, prepared the way of escape for us!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">93</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what he did!&rdquo; answered Jimmie.
&ldquo;And I wish he had gone a little farther and
prepared a good fat meat pie for us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jimmie,&rdquo; Ned chuckled, &ldquo;some day you&rsquo;ll
get into a corner where you won&rsquo;t get anything
to eat for a week. I never knew a boy who
thought so much of his stomach as you do!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May the day be long delayed!&rdquo; laughed
Jimmie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, crawl along!&rdquo; Ned advised, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll
see if I can get this slab of stone you pushed out
back in its place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was by no means a difficult task to replace
the stone, as it was thin and had been nicely
fitted into the opening. In a short time the boys,
proceeding mostly on their hands and knees,
came to the end of the tunnel and looked out
over a valley tucked in between two great
summits.</p>
<p>The snow-line was not far away and the air
was cold, notwithstanding the direct rays of the
sun.</p>
<p>There was no one in sight, no moving object
anywhere, as the boys paused at the mouth of
the passage and gazed about. Judging from
the location of the sun, they were looking straight
west.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; Ned said after a pause, &ldquo;if we follow
this little valley straight to the south, we&rsquo;ll come
out somewhere near our camp.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">94</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Jimmie answered, &ldquo;I have a pious
notion that our brownstone front is carved into
the face of a continuation of that ridge on the
other side of the little valley.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps we&rsquo;ll find the Boy Scout messenger
at the camp,&rdquo; Ned suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we do,&rdquo; Jimmie declared, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll change
his face for him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t understand the fellow,&rdquo; Ned admitted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee!&rdquo; cried Jimmie, &ldquo;He came out into the
woods and told Frank and I to beat it, then went
up into the camp and led you into the clutches
of these outlaws. If I had his head in chancery
right now, I&rsquo;d &lsquo;beat it&rsquo;, all right! He ought
to get a thousand years!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope the boys are all safe,&rdquo; said Ned.</p>
<p>Jimmie told his chum of the arrival of Gilroy,
and then the two boys hastened toward the
camp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The outlaws were discussing the advisability
of taking all the boys into their care,&rdquo; Ned said,
as they hustled along, &ldquo;so I&rsquo;m afraid they&rsquo;ve
been there and taken the lads by surprise.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">95</div>
<h2 id="c9"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER IX</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">IN QUEST OF INFORMATION</span></h2>
<p>Left at the camp by the departure of Ned and
Jimmie, Jack, Frank and Harry sat for a long
time in the warm sunshine in front of the barrier
and discussed the situation. Gilroy had tucked
himself into a collection of blankets at the rear
of the cave and was sound asleep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think Jimmie had in his mind
when he went away alone?&rdquo; asked Harry.
&ldquo;He merely had some plan to carry out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;s always going off alone,&rdquo; Jack
answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some day he&rsquo;ll go away alone and won&rsquo;t be
able to get back!&rdquo; Frank put in. &ldquo;He won&rsquo;t
always be able to get out of his scrapes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pretty foxy boy, that!&rdquo; Jack declared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What strikes me as being singular,&rdquo; Frank
suggested, &ldquo;is that Jack&rsquo;s father never said a
word to him about this land business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father never talks his business over with
any one,&rdquo; Jack broke in.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">96</div>
<p>&ldquo;If we had only known about the outlaws
being here in the hills,&rdquo; Harry suggested, &ldquo;we
might have kept out of sight of them for a long
time. But, you see, they found us first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And they used a nice, crooked little spy to
do it with!&rdquo; Frank exclaimed. &ldquo;This little
alleged Boy Scout who stole our provisions last
night, and crept into the woods to tell Jimmie
and I to beat it, and then brought a note to Ned
to get him away from the camp, must be playing
a leading part for the sneaks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s doing all of that!&rdquo; Jack agreed. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t believe he&rsquo;s a Boy Scout at all. He&rsquo;s
just picked up a word or two and a sign.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps we&rsquo;ll run across him again,&rdquo; Frank
said. &ldquo;If we do, I&rsquo;ll find out whether he&rsquo;s a
Boy Scout or not!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Jack exclaimed, springing to his feet,
&ldquo;are we going to sit here all day and let Jimmie
do all the hunting? We ought to get out in the
mountains and help find Ned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here, boys!&rdquo; Harry cried, &ldquo;do you see
anything to the east there that looks at all
familiar?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean the smoke coming up over the
tops of the trees?&rdquo; asked Frank. &ldquo;I noticed
that several minutes ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, just keep your eye on it,&rdquo; Harry
advised, &ldquo;and see if it brings anything to your
mind.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">97</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sure it does!&rdquo; shouted Frank, all excitement
now. &ldquo;There are two columns of smoke close
together, and you ought to know what that
means.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indian sign! Boy Scout sign! Means &lsquo;Help
is wanted&rsquo;!&rdquo; exclaimed Harry. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got
to go and see what it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may be Jimmie,&rdquo; Jack suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s either Jimmie or that messenger boy,&rdquo;
Frank said. &ldquo;If it&rsquo;s Jimmie, he&rsquo;s really in
trouble, and if it&rsquo;s the messenger boy, he&rsquo;s doing
it to get more of us into his clutches.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;d better go well armed and ready
for any kind of a reception,&rdquo; Jack advised.
&ldquo;No knowing what we&rsquo;ll find.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;ll we do with Gilroy?&rdquo; asked Frank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw, let him sleep,&rdquo; advised Harry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, let him sleep,&rdquo; Jack put in. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be
all right &rsquo;till we get back. No one will molest
the camp in daytime.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seems to me that we ought to leave someone
here,&rdquo; Frank said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, you can stay if you want to!&rdquo;
Jack declared. &ldquo;Harry and I are going down
there to see what the trouble is about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw, come on, Frank!&rdquo; Harry urged. &ldquo;There
won&rsquo;t anything happen to Gilroy! He may have
a bad dream, but that&rsquo;s about all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How far do you suppose that signal is from
here?&rdquo; asked Frank.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">98</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not more than half a mile,&rdquo; Harry explained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll go,&rdquo; Frank decided. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like
the idea of sitting around the camp and letting
you boys have all the fun. Besides,&rdquo; he continued,
&ldquo;if it is the messenger who is making
the signals, you&rsquo;ll need all the help you can get.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come running, then!&rdquo; advised Jack, starting
down the slope.</p>
<p>As the reader will remember, the signal
observed by the boys had been built by Jimmie
in the hope of attracting the attention of Ned,
or of Norman, the boy who had made himself
so conspicuous that morning. In building the
fires and creating the columns of dense white
smoke by heaping on green boughs, the boy had
not given serious thought to the effect his action
might have on his chums.</p>
<p>In fact, at the time of his leaving camp, he
had not fully decided what course to pursue,
and for this reason he had not informed the boys
of his intention to set a signal for the benefit
of the mysterious Boy Scout. Even at the time
of making the signal, he had no idea that it would
actually draw his three chums away from the
camp.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">99</div>
<p>He might have known what the effect would
be, but, though he did stop to consider for a
moment, he did not take in the whole situation.
Jimmie usually acted on impulse, and so the
signal lifted to the sky without any explanation
having been made to the Boy Scouts who were
certain to see it.</p>
<p>It will be remembered that when Jimmie
descended from the elevation where the fires
had been built he did so in order to hasten in the
direction of a smoke signal which he saw to the
north. The result of this was that he was out
of the vicinity of the fires long before the boys
reached that point.</p>
<p>When the three lads came to the finger of
granite upon the top of which the two fires
showed, they first made a careful examination
of the thickets close by and then ascended to the
top.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These fires were made to constitute a signal,
all right!&rdquo; Jack declared, poking at the now
dying embers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure!&rdquo; answered Frank. &ldquo;You see, no
cooking was done here, and there is no camp in
sight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Besides, the position of the blazes on this
high rock shows that the fires were built so that
the columns of smoke might be seen,&rdquo; suggested
Harry. &ldquo;It was Indian talk, all right!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s no one here in need of help so
far as I can see!&rdquo; laughed Jack, &ldquo;and so we may
as well go back to the camp.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">100</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the thing to do,&rdquo; Frank urged. &ldquo;To
tell the truth, I don&rsquo;t feel exactly right about
leaving Gilroy there alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw, we&rsquo;ll hear him sleeping before we get
within a rod of the cave,&rdquo; laughed Jack. &ldquo;Gilroy
is a good old chap, and father thinks a lot of him,
but he doesn&rsquo;t know much about this kind of a
life. I&rsquo;ll bet that right now he&rsquo;s dreaming about
grizzly bears, and lions, and crocodiles, and
panthers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From their position in the forest, after their
departure from the rock, they could see nothing
of the signal from the north which had attracted
Jimmie&rsquo;s attention, so there seemed nothing for
them to do but to return to camp. Therefore
they set out at good speed.</p>
<p>After a short walk, Jack beckoned the boys
to his side and suggested that they take a route
to the camp different from that which they had
followed on leaving it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see, boys,&rdquo; he explained, &ldquo;that was a
signal, all right, and we haven&rsquo;t found out the
cause of it. So far as we know, it was put up
to get us away from the camp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m beginning to think it was,&rdquo; Frank
announced. &ldquo;Either to get us away from the
camp for the purpose of capturing us, or for the
purpose of raiding our provisions.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">101</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Jack went on, &ldquo;if we duck away to
the south and return to the camp by a new
course, anyone watching for us might watch in
vain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the idea!&rdquo; Harry answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then here we go the south,&rdquo; Frank suggested,
starting away at as swift a gait as was
possible in the thicket.</p>
<p>They had proceeded but a short distance when
every tree bole of good size immediately in front
of them seemed to their astonished eyes to yield
a scowling, dirty half-breed. The boys drew
their guns.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No use, lads!&rdquo; a voice said, speaking in
good English. &ldquo;The men in the bushes have
you covered. Anyway, there&rsquo;s no harm intended.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why the holdup?&rdquo; demanded Jack.</p>
<p>The man who had spoken now advanced to
Jack and looked him keenly in the face.
Although carrying the general appearance of
the gang of half-breeds at his back, the boys
could see by the fellow&rsquo;s face and manner that
he was different from the others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are Jack Bosworth?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s my name,&rdquo; replied the boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are here on a mission for your father?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am here on a hunting trip.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With business on the side, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No business at all,&rdquo; replied Jack.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">102</div>
<p>&ldquo;We know better than that!&rdquo; the stranger
answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you want of us?&rdquo; asked Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We want information now in your possession,&rdquo;
answered the fellow, looking Jack sharply
in the eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What kind of information?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We want to know where certain documents
are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to ask some one else, then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are certain that you have the information
we require.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I had,&rdquo; Jack answered, &ldquo;you never would
get it from me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will gain nothing by being obstinate,&rdquo;
the fellow said. &ldquo;Remember that we have Ned
Nestor, the alleged juvenile detective, at our
camp. He seems inclined to keep what information
he possesses to himself, and, before proceeding
to extreme measures with him, we
decided to lay the case before you. I am afraid
Nestor will receive rough treatment at the
hands of my allies unless the information they
demand is given them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So that was a lying message you sent Nestor,
was it?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">103</div>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no use in discussing the matter at
length,&rdquo; the other stated. &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;d better
take you boys into camp and let the boss talk
with you. And let me warn you now, before
anything more is said, not to attempt resistance.
If you do, there&rsquo;ll be shooting done, and it won&rsquo;t
be my men who will get hurt! Now, face about
to the north and march away to camp, like good
little boys. We don&rsquo;t want to hurt you, but we
insist on having our way in the matter of this
information. Perhaps Nestor may be able to
convince you that you ought not to be so
obstinate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think Nestor will attempt anything
of the kind,&rdquo; replied Jack, &ldquo;and I think that
you are a great big bluff!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">104</div>
<h2 id="c10"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER X</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">GILROY AND THE BEAR</span></h2>
<p>When, at last, Ned and Jimmie, still watching
about for hostile forces, came to the barricaded
camp, the fire had burned down and no one was
in sight. Ned regarded the wall of rock with
a smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that great?&rdquo; Jimmie asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid it wouldn&rsquo;t do much good in case
of an attack,&rdquo; Ned suggested. &ldquo;We&rsquo;d soon get
hungry and thirsty and have to surrender.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyway, it&rsquo;s an all right thing to shoot
from!&rdquo; Jimmie announced. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;d seen the
way we sweat rolling those rocks, you&rsquo;d think
it was all right, anyway. I wonder where the
boys are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was thinking more about the boys than
about the barricade,&rdquo; Ned admitted. &ldquo;Were
they all here when you left?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All sitting in front of the entrance,&rdquo; Jimmie
replied, &ldquo;except Gilroy, and he was asleep on a
pile of blankets in the cave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He may be there yet,&rdquo; suggested Ned.
&ldquo;Suppose we go and see.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">105</div>
<p>Jimmie made his way through the narrow
entrance, found a searchlight, and turned a
round circle of flame on a great heap of blankets
in a back corner. There was no one in the cave
at all save only himself.</p>
<p>Before returning to report to Ned, the hungry
boy seized a plate of corn pones and a can of
tinned beans from the provision chest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here, Ned,&rdquo; he said in a moment,
appearing before his chum with his mouth full
of beans, &ldquo;the appetite of our midnight visitor
seems to be for confidential clerks as well as for
bread. Someone has stolen Gilroy! Anyway,
he&rsquo;s not in the cave!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He may have gone away with the boys,&rdquo;
suggested Ned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He wasn&rsquo;t thinking of going away with the
boys when I left,&rdquo; Jimmie answered. &ldquo;He was
telling how much he liked New York, and how
he&rsquo;d like to pound his ear for about three days
and nights.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyway,&rdquo; Ned decided, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll wait here a
little while and see if they don&rsquo;t return. In the
meantime, you can get yourself something to
eat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you call this something to eat?&rdquo;
asked Jimmie.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">106</div>
<p>&ldquo;One poor little can of beans and one poor
little plate of corn pones won&rsquo;t make much of an
impression on your appetite,&rdquo; Ned laughed.
&ldquo;What you need is one of those neat little bear
steaks, about as large as a warming pan. You&rsquo;ll
have plenty of time in which to cook it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that means that I can cook one for you,
too?&rdquo; asked Jimmie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, of course you can!&rdquo; returned Ned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to cook one for the Boy Scout who
got us both into such trouble,&rdquo; Jimmie declared.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d put poison on it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, don&rsquo;t you be too severe on that Boy
Scout,&rdquo; Ned advised. &ldquo;According to your own
story, he warned you and Frank in the thicket,
and I know very well that he wanted to tell me
something, but didn&rsquo;t dare do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, here&rsquo;s another thing,&rdquo; Jimmie explained.
&ldquo;When I went out to look for you,
I gave the &lsquo;help&rsquo; smoke signal from the top of a
granite rock in the pines. In five minutes after
the columns of smoke became large enough to
be seen at a distance, the signal was answered
from the north, it seemed to me from the
vicinity of the old mission. Now, of course,
you didn&rsquo;t send out that signal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I rather think not,&rdquo; smiled Ned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it was sent up by this crooked messenger
boy with the intention of getting us out to
look for you. He believed, of course, that we
would regard the call for help as coming from
you and rush away from camp.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">107</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be too sure of that,&rdquo; warned Ned.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s something about that boy I rather
like. Besides, he really is a member of the Wolf
Patrol, New York.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My own patrol?&rdquo; exclaimed Jimmie. &ldquo;I
never saw him at the club room. He told me
that he belonged to the Wolf Patrol, but I
didn&rsquo;t believe it. I think he&rsquo;s a fake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Time alone will tell,&rdquo; answered Ned. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
going to believe in the boy until I get some
positive proof that he really is crooked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jimmie was about to continue the argument
when a succession of shrieks and calls for help
came from the forest on the slope below.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, what&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; demanded Jimmie.
&ldquo;That isn&rsquo;t any of our boys!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Help! Help! Help!&rdquo; cried the voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Ned agreed, &ldquo;our boys don&rsquo;t make a
racket like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say!&rdquo; Jimmie shouted, springing to his feet.
&ldquo;I bet you the next dollar I don&rsquo;t find that
that&rsquo;s the fat clerk, Gilroy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The voice sounds like that of a fat man,&rdquo;
Ned laughed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">108</div>
<p>&ldquo;Gilroy&rsquo;s fat all right!&rdquo; Jimmie exclaimed.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s got one of those pink baby faces that
make you hungry to look at. He makes me
think of a roast of veal, and he&rsquo;s got a cute
little round bald spot on the top of his head.
And he wants to be dignified and speaks his
words impressively. Say, Ned,&rdquo; the boy continued,
&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t mind having that fellow
get into some kind of a mixup out here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh Lord! Oh Lord! Oh Lord!&rdquo; cried the
voice from the forest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Gilroy, all right enough!&rdquo; Ned
declared. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you go down and see
what he wants, Jimmie?&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw, he ain&rsquo;t talking to me!&rdquo; cried the boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I presume I&rsquo;ll have to go,&rdquo; Ned said,
rising from his seat in front of the barrier.
&ldquo;Perhaps he&rsquo;s been stung by a bee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t get crippled in his shrieker,&rdquo;
Jimmie suggested.</p>
<p>Ned stepped into the cave and secured an
automatic revolver to replace the one taken from
him at the old mission, and also passed one to
Jimmie. Then the two hastened into the forest
in the direction of the sounds.</p>
<p>The call for help continued to come, although
the voice of the man came hoarser at every call.
When the boys finally came close enough to
distinguish words spoken in low tones, they
heard a warning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shoot!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a lot of bears
under this tree!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">109</div>
<p>Although convulsed with laughter, the boys
moved more cautiously after this. At last they
came to the pine from which the voice proceeded.
There was a rustle in the thicket as they advanced,
and they saw a black object shambling
away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s Gilroy&rsquo;s flock of bears!&rdquo; Jimmie
shouted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And a little bit of a black bear at that,&rdquo;
Ned laughed. &ldquo;If Gilroy had made an ugly
face at him, he&rsquo;d have run away!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tree into which the fat confidential clerk
had climbed was not a large one. In fact, it
was swaying dangerously under his weight. As
he moved his position at sight of the black back
of the bear, the slender upshoot to which he
clung gave way and he came clattering down
through the few lower branches.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh my! oh my! oh my!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;I
never should have come into this blasted
country! I shall be eaten alive!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Instead of rushing to Gilroy&rsquo;s assistance, his
rescuers, boy-like, sat down on the mat of pine
needles which strewed the ground and roared
with laughter. Gilroy eyed them angrily without
attempting to rise to his feet. His rage only
made the scene more amusing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you shoot him?&rdquo; he demanded
at length.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">110</div>
<p>&ldquo;Shoot him?&rdquo; repeated Jimmie. &ldquo;That bear
is a great deal more frightened than you are.
At the rate of speed he&rsquo;s now going, he&rsquo;ll strike
the arctic circle at exactly four-fifteen tomorrow
morning!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He chased me up the tree,&rdquo; whined Gilroy.
&ldquo;He nipped at my heels as I left the ground,
and I heard his teeth grinding together in the
most frightful manner. I&rsquo;ll never get over
this!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess he would have climbed the tree after
you in about another minute,&rdquo; Jimmie declared,
with a sly wink at Ned. &ldquo;You see, it&rsquo;s just this
way, Mr. Gilroy,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;the bears out
here are hungry for fat clerks from Wall street.
I&rsquo;ve heard they make stews of &rsquo;em,&rdquo; he concluded.</p>
<p>Gilroy now arose to his feet and stood gazing
into the thicket in the direction of the bear&rsquo;s
disappearance. Jimmie&rsquo;s assertion that bruin
would hit the Arctic circle early the next morning
seemed to give him great comfort. As the
distance between the bear and himself increased,
he grew braver and began throwing out his
chest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a chance that was for me to kill a
bear!&rdquo; he began, boastfully, &ldquo;If I&rsquo;d only had
a gun with me, I might have had a fine rug
made out of his hide! It would have been fine
to show my friends.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">111</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sure it would!&rdquo; declared Jimmie. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
glad you didn&rsquo;t remember that you had a gun
in your pocket. The bears out here are pretty
sensitive about being shot at. If you&rsquo;d blazed
away at that cub, and hadn&rsquo;t shot him dead in
his tracks the first time, he would have eaten
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gilroy put his hand to his pistol pocket and a
look of pretended amazement came over his
fat face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Upon my word!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I thought I left
my gun in the bunk!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;After this,&rdquo; Ned advised, &ldquo;always keep your
gun in sight when you go into the forest. Suppose
there had been no tree to climb, what
then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should have grappled with him, sir!&rdquo;
exclaimed Gilroy. &ldquo;I certainly should have
grappled with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You would have had to catch him first,&rdquo;
Jimmie grinned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long since you left the camp?&rdquo; Ned
asked, after Jimmie had introduced the two.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps half an hour ago,&rdquo; was the answer.
&ldquo;When I went to sleep, the boys were sitting by
the fire, but when I woke there was no one in
sight. I came out to look for them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I understand you came on a mission for
Jack Bosworth&rsquo;s father?&rdquo; asked Ned after a
pause.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">112</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; was the reply, &ldquo;at the request of my
employer I came on this most dangerous mission.
I shall be glad to see New York again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ned hesitated a moment and then asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did Mr. Bosworth ever say anything to you
about a set of documents he wished us to bring
to light?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He did not,&rdquo; was the answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His purpose in sending you, then, was to
secure, by means of our help, proof connecting
a corporation he is fighting with unlawful acts
which have been or may be committed in this
section?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is exactly the idea!&rdquo; answered Gilroy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; Jimmie shouted, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s get back
to camp. I begin to feel hungry already.
Perhaps the boys have returned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before Gilroy would move out of the forest
he insisted on pinning up certain rents in his
clothing and combing out his mussed up hair
with his fingers. There were also numerous
scratches on his face, caused by contact with
the rough branches of the tree, and these he
thought necessary to nurse carefully with his
handkerchief.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">113</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh my!&rdquo; laughed Jimmie, as the fat confidential
clerk struggled under difficulties to make
himself more presentable. &ldquo;If you think you&rsquo;re
in a muss, just look at this beautiful new khaki
uniform I put on only a day or two ago! It&rsquo;s a
peach, ain&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It certainly is in a mess,&rdquo; admitted Gilroy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; grinned Jimmie. &ldquo;I fell down
a chute, and rolled into the basement of a
mountain, and climbed up a smutty chimney,
and fell into a secret passage and had all kinds
of sport! Ned and I have had a glorious morning.
You should have been with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The confidential clerk frowned slightly, but
made no reply.</p>
<p>When the boys reached the camp, after giving
a great deal of mental and physical assistance
to the clerk, they found it just as they had left
it. The boys had not returned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, what kind of blockheads do you think
they are to go away and leave the camp like
this?&rdquo; Jimmie asked.</p>
<p>The boy did not know, of course, that his
own signal, shown from the granite rock, had
led to their departure, and also to their subsequent
encounter with the half-breeds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know why they left,&rdquo; Ned answered,
&ldquo;but we must suppose that they had
some good reason for doing so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do I understand,&rdquo; Gilroy asked, &ldquo;that
something has happened to your companions?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All we know about it is that they&rsquo;re not here,&rdquo;
replied Jimmie.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">114</div>
<p>&ldquo;There are altogether too many bears in this
forest,&rdquo; suggested Gilroy. &ldquo;The lads may have
encountered some of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a fact!&rdquo; laughed Jimmie. &ldquo;Perhaps
we&rsquo;d better go out and see if we can find a group
of pine trees bearing a mess of Boy Scouts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a serious matter,&rdquo; Ned interrupted.
&ldquo;Judging from our own experiences, the boys
may be having a bad time of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The outlaws are none too good to commit
murder!&rdquo; Jimmie asserted.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">115</div>
<h2 id="c11"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XI</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE DEVIL&rsquo;S PUNCH BOWL</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;See here, boys,&rdquo; Frank Shaw suggested, as
the three boys moved on through the forest,
almost entirely surrounded by repulsive half-breeds,
&ldquo;this will be a fine story for Dad&rsquo;s
newspaper. &lsquo;Captured by Bold, Bad Men; or,
Why Little Frankie Didn&rsquo;t Get Home to His
Beans&rsquo;! That would be a fine title for the
story, and I&rsquo;ll ask Dad to print a picture of
three boys wandering through a jungle surrounded
by a bunch of cheap skates that no
decent dog would bark at.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep still!&rdquo; whispered Harry. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the
use of stirring these people up? We&rsquo;re in no
shape to scrap with them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then,&rdquo; Frank went on, &ldquo;Dad might take
a notion to send an expedition out here to round
up these dirty greasers. If he does, I&rsquo;m coming
out just on purpose to see them hanged.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cut it out!&rdquo; advised Jack.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">116</div>
<p>&ldquo;Of all the rotten, unwashed specimens of
humanity I ever came across,&rdquo; Frank continued,
speaking in a still louder tone, &ldquo;this escort of
ours takes the bun. They&rsquo;re imitation bad-men
all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A little of that goes a long way, young man,&rdquo;
the leader of the party said. &ldquo;It makes no
difference to me what you say, but several of
these men understand the English language and
can speak it fluently.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I presume so,&rdquo; returned Frank. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen
just such a collection as that in jail in New York.
Say, honest, Captain,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;if a bunch
like this should run up against the strong-arm
squad in New York, they&rsquo;d get their heads
beaten off just because of their ugly mugs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw, what&rsquo;s the use!&rdquo; demanded Harry.</p>
<p>By this time several of the guards were casting
ugly glances at Frank, who seemed to regard
their disfavor with great joy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better come on ahead and walk with
me, young fellow,&rdquo; the leader said, taking Frank
roughly by the arm and jerking him to a position
in front. &ldquo;If you get back there where those
ugly ones are, they&rsquo;ll put a couple of bullets
into your back and swear that you were trying
to escape.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On his way to the front of the party, Frank
passed Jack and paused for a second only to
whisper in his ear:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">117</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now, these ginks will be watching me every
minute, waiting for a chance to shoot. You may
catch them off their guard directly and when
you do, cut and run!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s what you did all the talking for?&rdquo;
queried Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You bet!&rdquo; answered Frank. &ldquo;And while
you&rsquo;re running, I&rsquo;ll do a little sprinting myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, you!&rdquo; shouted the leader, almost
lifting Frank&rsquo;s feet from the ground as he
dragged him away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What were you whispering to that boy?&rdquo;
demanded one of the others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was telling him,&rdquo; Frank answered, making
an insulting face, &ldquo;that I used to have a dog
that looked exactly like you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fellow thus insulted sprang for the boy
with upraised fist. The leader blocked his rush
by imposing his own burly form, and the two
went down together. The half-breeds sprang
forward, too, the intention evidently being to
assist their companion as against the leader.</p>
<p>Frank let out a yell which might have been
heard half a mile away, and the three boys
darted down the mountainside, followed by
harmless shots from the guns of the half-breeds.</p>
<p>The incident had taken place on a rocky level
flanked by steep slopes on each side. The place,
in fact, was almost like a shelf of rock cut into
a long fifty percent grade.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">118</div>
<p>The ledge was narrow, and as the bunch clung
together where the leader and his opponent still
struggled, one of them slipped over the edge of
the declivity and started downward. Naturally
he caught hold of the first object within his
reach, and this happened to be the shoe of the
outlaw nearest to him. This man, in turn,
caught another, and two more tried to pull up
the falling ones, with the result that in about
half a minute five of the half-breeds were rolling
and tumbling heels over head down the rocky
slope.</p>
<p>The boys were not far out of their path, but
they managed to elude the downrushing bodies
as they swung by. Notwithstanding the gravity
of the situation, the boys shrieked with laughter
as the clumsy fellows went tumbling down,
uttering vicious curses at the boys, at the
mountain and at each other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I had a gun now!&rdquo; shouted Frank.</p>
<p>As he spoke a formidable weapon which
seemed to be half revolver and half sawed-off
shotgun, flew out of the hands of one of the
involuntary acrobats and landed against
Frank&rsquo;s side with a great thud.</p>
<p>Frank seized the weapon and backed away.
By this time the leader was on his feet shouting
wrathful commands for the boys to return.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">119</div>
<p>&ldquo;Easy, now,&rdquo; Frank shouted, moving away
to the south. &ldquo;If any of you ginks lift a finger
until we get into the timber line, I&rsquo;ll empty
this load of slugs into the thick of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The leader, more daring than the others,
sprang down the slope, his great boots scattering
fragments of rock and sending them hurtling
down upon the heads of the half-breeds below.
Frank was about to fire when the man lost his
balance and joined the procession of those
making for the bottom a la log.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here we go!&rdquo; shouted Frank.</p>
<p>The boys raced along the slope until they
came to a point of timber which, following a
more fertile spot, thrust itself up the ascent.
Here they disappeared, considering themselves
reasonably safe in the seclusion of the forest.
Frank examined his gun and found it empty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good thing that dub didn&rsquo;t know it was
empty!&rdquo; he laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t stop now to throw bouquets at yourself!&rdquo;
grinned Harry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right!&rdquo; Jack declared. &ldquo;We want
to be getting back to the camp. Gilroy&rsquo;ll have
a fit if he wakes up and finds us gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you ever think those half-breeds will
give up the chase here,&rdquo; Frank suggested. &ldquo;Do
you know what they&rsquo;ll do?&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll
circle around and get between us and the camp!
That&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;ll do.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">120</div>
<p>&ldquo;I sometimes think,&rdquo; Harry snorted, turning
to Jack, &ldquo;that Frank is getting so intelligent
that he may have the gift of speech conferred
upon him. He certainly has that proposition
right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if we can&rsquo;t go back to camp,&rdquo; Jack
asked, &ldquo;where can we go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to glide into some gentle dell in
the bosom of a friendly hill!&rdquo; laughed Harry,
&ldquo;and send a scout out to watch those fellows spy
upon the camp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If they&rsquo;ve got a detachment of half-breeds
guarding every squad of Boy Scouts that have
strayed away from the camp today,&rdquo; Jack
laughed, &ldquo;they must have an army in here.
Ned was coaxed away by a fake note; Jimmie
went to find Ned and got lost himself, and we
go out to answer a call for help and get mixed up
with a lot of half-breeds. I guess we&rsquo;ll have
to take a company of state troops with us next
time we go camping.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, let&rsquo;s be moving,&rdquo; urged Frank. &ldquo;Those
fellows&rsquo; heads will be just sore enough when they
quit rolling to shoot at anything in sight. They&rsquo;d
string us up if they caught us now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In accordance with this reasoning, the boys
turned south in the thicket then shifted to the
east, then whirled back in a northerly direction.
At one time they heard the shouts of the half-breeds
on the slope far away to the south.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">121</div>
<p>&ldquo;They think we kept right on south,&rdquo;
laughed Jack. &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll
walk north a long ways, climb the slope to the
snow line, and come out on the camp from above.
How&rsquo;s that strike you boys?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It listens good to me,&rdquo; Frank answered.
&ldquo;Do you suppose Ned is back there yet?&rdquo; he
continued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It struck me,&rdquo; Jack replied, &ldquo;that the half-breeds
we encountered were out looking for Ned
or Jimmie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to guess again,&rdquo; Harry put in.
&ldquo;The ginks we encountered were stationed there
to catch any Boy Scout who came in answer to
that signal. That&rsquo;s some more of the work of
that crooked messenger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I hope the bears won&rsquo;t devour Gilroy
while we&rsquo;re gone,&rdquo; Frank suggested. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
likely to be night before we get back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys walked for a long distance, and it
was three o&rsquo;clock by their watches when they
turned up the slope. They would have felt less
comfortable during the latter part of their
journey if they had known that they were
passing within a few hundred yards of the
headquarters of the outlaws at the old mission.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">122</div>
<p>After a time they came to what looked like a
wrinkle in the face of the grand old mountain.
They proceeded up this with no little caution,
not knowing but enemies might be watching
there. It was just such a place as outlaws
lurking for prey or cowering from officers would
be apt to seek. The wrinkle, or gully, led
almost to the snow line and finally ended in a
little dip which lay between two summits rising
side by side, like jagged rows of teeth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m half starved and half frozen!&rdquo; Harry
declared, as he rested for a time in the depth of
what had once been a mountain lake, but which
had been drained by the gully. &ldquo;If I ever get
back in little old New York again, I&rsquo;m going to
get Dad to make me a gasoline buggy with a
snout nine feet long, and I&rsquo;m going to push
traffic aside on Broadway for the next thousand
years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How often have you said that?&rdquo; laughed
Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see,&rdquo; Frank put in, &ldquo;this is the twelfth
trip we boys have taken, either in the interests
of the Secret Service or on vacations, so this
makes twelve times that Harry has promised
never to leave New York again once he gets
back there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right!&rdquo; Harry grinned. &ldquo;You
fellows ain&rsquo;t half so hungry as I am or you
wouldn&rsquo;t feel so gay over it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, how far are we from camp?&rdquo; asked
Jack.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">123</div>
<p>&ldquo;About two miles on the level,&rdquo; Frank
suggested, &ldquo;and about four hundred miles the
way the surface of the ground runs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a short rest the boys proceeded south,
climbing over jutting spurs, dipping into depressions,
and sliding over stony slopes until
they were almost too tired to take another step.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get used to this in a month or two,&rdquo;
Harry said, sitting plump down on a boulder.</p>
<p>Frank followed the boy&rsquo;s example, except
that he stretched himself at full length, while
Jack pushed on a few steps and stood peering
over a rim of rock which lay directly in their
way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here, boys!&rdquo; Jack finally called.
&ldquo;You remember the place in Mexico called the
Devil&rsquo;s Cauldron? Well, this is it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What have you found now?&rdquo; demanded
Frank sleepily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a round hole in the mountain,&rdquo; Jack
answered back, &ldquo;that you might hide a city
block in. It&rsquo;s deep and the sides are almost
smooth. Looks like the pit Kipling gets one of
his characters in, only there&rsquo;s rock instead of
sand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys rose to their feet and looked over
the ledge.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">124</div>
<p>&ldquo;And right there in the bottom,&rdquo; Harry exclaimed,
&ldquo;is a pool of water so clear that it looks
like a diamond!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Running water, too,&rdquo; added Frank. &ldquo;Now,
where do you think that water comes from, and
where does it go to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Runs through a pass, foolish!&rdquo; answered
Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But there&rsquo;s no break in the formation,&rdquo;
Frank insisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it runs through a tunnel manufactured
by itself!&rdquo; Jack explained. &ldquo;Anyway, it gets
out somehow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a dandy place to catch mountain
trout!&rdquo; shouted Harry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you get down there once and you&rsquo;d
think it was a dandy place!&rdquo; laughed Frank.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;d never get out in a hundred years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to see if there are fish there, anyway,&rdquo;
suggested Harry. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard so much
about the firm flesh of fish caught in mountain
streams that I&rsquo;d like to investigate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Investigate nothing!&rdquo; laughed Jack. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d
starve to death there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that doesn&rsquo;t look so worse!&rdquo; exclaimed
Harry.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">125</div>
<p>The boy leaned far over as he spoke. The
stone upon which his breast pressed dropped
away with a crash. The boy&rsquo;s heels flew into
the air, and the next moment he was sliding
down the awful declivity.</p>
<p>Jack and Frank heard the cry of terror as the
boy disappeared and closed their eyes to shut
out the horrible sight which they believed to be
due the next instant.</p>

<br /><span class="h2line2">TREACHERY FEARED</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;I would suggest,&rdquo; Gilroy remarked, as the
boys stood in front of the barrier looking
anxiously out in every direction, &ldquo;that you prepare
a bit of luncheon. I must confess that this
mountain air gives me an appetite, and I had a
light breakfast, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; Jimmie replied. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll build a
fire, put on the big kettle and make a bear stew
that will put an inch of fat on your ribs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A bear stew?&rdquo; repeated Gilroy, holding up
his white hands in horror.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, a bear stew.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean to say that the ferocious
creatures known as bears are served as food in
this outrageous country, do you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly!&rdquo; laughed Jimmie. &ldquo;The bear
is the noblest work of God when it comes to
making a stew.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t eat bear stew, indeed I couldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo;
gasped Gilroy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; Jimmie said, &ldquo;then we&rsquo;ll cook
you some eggs.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">127</div>
<p>The boy set to work preparing the stew. The
larder was well stocked with provisions, and he
had plenty of vegetables and rice to use, so in a
couple of hours he had a great kettle bubbling
fragrantly over the fire. Gilroy was supplied
with eggs and soda biscuit.</p>
<p>Leaving the confidential clerk munching his
supper and looking about for bears, Ned and
Jimmie walked around the corner of rock and
stood looking over the fast-darkening landscape.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what it is,&rdquo; Jimmie said, at
length. &ldquo;Those boys are in trouble somewhere.
It&rsquo;s an even bet that they&rsquo;ve been geezled by the
ginks that grabbed us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; Ned answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; Jimmie went on, in a moment.
&ldquo;I know the way to that old mission place. I
could find my way there in the dark of the moon
blindfolded. Now suppose I sneak over and
see if there&rsquo;s any trace of the boys there or
thereabouts?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d better wait a short time,&rdquo; Ned
answered. &ldquo;The outlaws in the subterranean
rooms will naturally be doubly watchful after
our sensational escape, and so we&rsquo;d better wait
until along in the night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They may not be there at all,&rdquo; Jimmie
finally said. &ldquo;They may be just lost in the
mountains.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">128</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think they would really get lost,&rdquo;
Ned decided.</p>
<p>While the boys talked around the angle of
rock, a shrill cry followed by a pistol shot came
from the camp.</p>
<p>In a moment Norman, the Boy Scout messenger
boy, came dashing around the corner, white-faced
and out of breath. He dropped down
close to where the boys were standing and
looked up at Ned with appealing eyes. He was
evidently very much exhausted, for his breath
came in short, hard gasps. There were spots
of blood on his hands, as if they had been torn
on rocky surfaces.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; asked Ned shortly. &ldquo;What do you
want here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Norman half arose and peered around the
angle of rock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I came running up to the fire a minute ago,&rdquo;
he said, still panting, &ldquo;and some one in the cave
shot at me as I passed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think you deserve shooting?&rdquo;
asked Ned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shooting for what?&rdquo; asked the other faintly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because you have proven yourself a treacherous
guide!&rdquo; answered Ned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw, pitch him down the hill!&rdquo; gritted
Jimmie.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">129</div>
<p>&ldquo;Wait until I explain!&rdquo; gasped Norman. &ldquo;I
have only a minute to spare.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what is it?&rdquo; asked Ned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And get a new plot this time!&rdquo; put in
Jimmie. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go to bringing out any old
fake note!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll understand, some day,&rdquo; Norman said,
lifting his eyes frankly to those of the boys.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll know all about it before long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get down to business!&rdquo; ordered Ned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then listen,&rdquo; Norman went on. &ldquo;Some of
your friends are in trouble up near the summit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you want us to follow you to the scene
of activity!&rdquo; laughed Jimmie. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s almost
as good as answering the note in person.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now listen to me,&rdquo; pleaded Norman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You worked that game once,&rdquo; roared
Jimmie. &ldquo;You got me geezled in the woods,
and you got Ned lugged into the old mission.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me tell you,&rdquo; Norman went on. &ldquo;I was
sent out into the mountains to look for you boys.
I went off to the west because I didn&rsquo;t want to
find you. I thought you wouldn&rsquo;t be in that
direction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s called &lsquo;bunk&rsquo; in New York,&rdquo; Jimmie
insisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let the boy have his say,&rdquo; Ned suggested.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">130</div>
<p>&ldquo;I went off to the west,&rdquo; continued Norman,
&ldquo;and walked a long way. I didn&rsquo;t want to go
back to the mission at all, but I knew that if I
didn&rsquo;t something serious would take place in
New York.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean by that?&rdquo; asked Jimmie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you,&rdquo; answered the boy. &ldquo;I
can only say that upon my keeping on good
terms with Toombs and his gang depends the
liberty and happiness of a person I am very
fond of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jimmie snorted his disbelief, but Ned motioned
for Norman to go on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I got high up on the hill, I came to a
depression known to the mountaineers as the
Devil&rsquo;s Punch Bowl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t any punch in it, was there?&rdquo; asked
Jimmie, in derision.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just as I was about to turn away, I heard
shouts from the bottom of the pit. I drew
nearer to the edge and looked down. Two boys
were beckoning and shouting to me to run for
assistance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two?&rdquo; asked Ned anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only two,&rdquo; replied Norman. &ldquo;There was
another lying on the ground and he looked to
me as if he might be dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you find out?&rdquo; asked Ned.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">131</div>
<p>&ldquo;There is always quite a wind up on the
mountains at this time of night,&rdquo; the boy
answered, &ldquo;and I couldn&rsquo;t understand all they
said. I understood, however, that they wanted
me to come for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you want us to go with you to this
Devil&rsquo;s Punch Bowl, I presume,&rdquo; scoffed Jimmie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you can find the place alone, I&rsquo;ll go back
to the old mission,&rdquo; answered Norman. &ldquo;It is
not so very far away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What sort of a place is this Devil&rsquo;s Punch
Bowl?&rdquo; asked Ned, moving toward the cave
and beckoning Norman to follow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is just a deep pit between two ridges,&rdquo;
was the answer. &ldquo;It must be a hundred or
more feet to the bottom. The sides are so
steep that escape from it is impossible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be a dangerous place,&rdquo; Ned agreed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The mountaineers claim that no one ever
left it alive,&rdquo; replied the boy with a very grave
face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What ought we to take with us,&rdquo; asked
Ned, &ldquo;in order to be of assistance to the boys?
What do you suggest?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must take plenty of ropes,&rdquo; was the
answer.</p>
<p>Jimmie looked up into Ned&rsquo;s face appealingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not going with this gink?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I certainly am,&rdquo; replied Ned. &ldquo;The boys
may really be in trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">132</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll go, too,&rdquo; Jimmie decided, &ldquo;but
I&rsquo;ll tell you right now that I don&rsquo;t believe a word
of this story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you show the way?&rdquo; asked Ned,
bringing out a large coil of rope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; was the reply, &ldquo;if you&rsquo;ll treat me
fairly while we&rsquo;re together. Some one shot at
me from the cave as I came by.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gilroy was now seen looking out of the cave.
The firelight showed a set and frightened face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the boy!&rdquo; he shouted, pointing a fat
finger at Norman. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the boy that tried
to sneak into the cave while you were away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the man that shot at me!&rdquo; Norman
said. &ldquo;I guess he thought I was a burglar. I
didn&rsquo;t try to get into the cave at all, but just
looked over the barrier.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw him trying to climb over!&rdquo; shouted
Gilroy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind all that now,&rdquo; Ned advised.
&ldquo;If the boys really are in trouble we can&rsquo;t afford
to lose any time getting to them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you another reason why you ought
to hurry,&rdquo; Norman went on, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been gone
from the camp quite a long time, and I don&rsquo;t
know what&rsquo;s going on there, of course, but I can
tell you right now that your camp will be
watched tonight. There may be someone
watching me now.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">133</div>
<p>&ldquo;What is the real object of all this?&rdquo; asked
Ned. &ldquo;We have nothing those fellows have
use for, either information or documents of any
kind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You probably couldn&rsquo;t make them believe
that,&rdquo; suggested Norman. &ldquo;At any rate,&rdquo; he
went on, &ldquo;if they believed what you say, they
would still try to drive you out of the country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Had the outlaws anything to do with the
plight in which you found the boys?&rdquo; asked
Jimmie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly not!&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;When the
boys escaped from the outlaws, they took the
upper route back to your cave and came upon
the Devil&rsquo;s Punch Bowl. My idea is that one
fell in and that the others, in some manner,
worked their way down to the bottom and
attempted to get him out. They didn&rsquo;t say so,
but that&rsquo;s the way it looked to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So the half-breeds captured the boys, did
they?&rdquo; Jimmie asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;Some one sent up a
Boy Scout help signal in the forest below here,
and the boys must have gone to see what it
meant. The half-breeds were wandering around
there and captured them, but the boys got away
by some trick or other and took to the mountain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jimmie stood looking at Ned with a shamed
face.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">134</div>
<p>&ldquo;Say!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I made that Boy Scout
signal, just before those ginks started to march
me off to the old mission. I never thought our
boys would take any notice of it. I guess I&rsquo;m
to blame for all this trouble, Ned. I must be
getting awful dense, never to remember that
our boys were looking for just such signs at the
time I left the camp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw the signal,&rdquo; Norman said, &ldquo;and
answered it. I was cooking in front of Toombs&rsquo;
tent when the two columns of smoke showed
and I built another fire on the plea that I needed
two to cook the dinner. The fires didn&rsquo;t make
much smoke, so I soaked some of the wood I put
on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I saw your signal, too,&rdquo; Jimmie explained,
&ldquo;and started toward it. That&rsquo;s the
time the half-breeds gave me the pinch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Ned, turning to Norman, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re
going to leave Gilroy, the man who mistook you
for a burglar, here to watch the camp while we
go to the assistance of the boys. I don&rsquo;t think
you&rsquo;d better go with us. We may come upon
a bunch of the outlaws and have to fight. If
with us, you would be recognized and that would
end your usefulness so far as we are concerned.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">135</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I can&rsquo;t help you any more,&rdquo;
Norman said hesitatingly. &ldquo;It would be terrible
if the news got back to New York that
I had turned traitor to Toombs. I can&rsquo;t endure
the thought!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What would happen?&rdquo; asked Jimmie. &ldquo;Why
don&rsquo;t you speak plainly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you what would happen,&rdquo; the
boy answered. &ldquo;It is something I don&rsquo;t even
dare think about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then of course you can&rsquo;t afford to accompany
us to the Devil&rsquo;s Punch Bowl,&rdquo; Ned said,
&ldquo;and I was about to suggest that you remain
here with Gilroy for a short time after our departure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw, let Gilroy take care of himself!&rdquo; Jimmie
said.</p>
<p>Ned laughed as he threw a long coil of rope
over his shoulder and provided himself with a
couple of electric flashlights.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gilroy,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;would be having three
fits at a time if he knew that we are leaving him
here alone in the night. If the boy will remain
a short time until we get out of sight and hearing,
that will help matters materially. You&rsquo;ll stay
will you?&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only a few minutes,&rdquo; answered Norman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if there is to be a raid on the camp tonight,&rdquo;
Ned went on, &ldquo;perhaps you may be able
to warn us in time.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">136</div>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t promise that,&rdquo; the boy said. &ldquo;I
can&rsquo;t take any chance on offending Mr. Toombs.
I know that he&rsquo;s a dirty trickster, and that he
means mischief to you boys, but I&rsquo;ve said all I
dare say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy entered the cave and engaged in conversation
with Gilroy, in accordance with Ned&rsquo;s
instructions, and Ned and Jimmie, who had in
the meantime received definite instructions as
to the location of the Devil&rsquo;s Punch Bowl,
started up the steep slope of the mountain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose the boy is lying?&rdquo; asked Jimmie
anxiously.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">137</div>
<h2 id="c13"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XIII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">AT THE BOTTOM OF THE BOWL</span></h2>
<p>Jack and Frank stood at the edge of the
Devil&rsquo;s Punch Bowl with their hearts beating
wildly, listening for the dreaded sound which
they knew must come from below. However,
no such sound came, and presently they found
the courage to cast their eyes down the steep
incline.</p>
<p>Far down, at the very bottom of the pit,
lying close to the edge of the pool of water
which had been observed before, they saw Harry,
lying perfectly motionless. He had fallen at
least a hundred feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s terrible!&rdquo; Frank faltered. &ldquo;I wish we
had never come into the mountains! I wish
we had never seen California.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He may not be dead,&rdquo; suggested Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not dead!&rdquo; repeated Frank. &ldquo;Not dead
after a fall like that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to give up hope until I&rsquo;m
sure!&rdquo; Jack answered stoutly.</p>
<p>The two boys stood for a moment gazing
down the tremendous fall, and then cast their
eyes over the landscape in every direction.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">138</div>
<p>&ldquo;What are you looking for?&rdquo; asked Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something that will help us lower into the
pit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we only had a long rope,&rdquo; Jack wailed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we haven&rsquo;t got any long rope,&rdquo; Frank
replied, &ldquo;and we&rsquo;ve just got to get down there.
We&rsquo;ve got to find a way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have been thinking,&rdquo; Jack stated after a
moment&rsquo;s thought, &ldquo;that we might possibly
work our way downward by circling about the
pit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean wind ourselves down like a cork-screw?&rdquo;
asked Frank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it exactly!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, the walls are almost perpendicular!&rdquo;
Frank asserted. &ldquo;We never can get down there
in the world!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ll have to hasten back to camp and
get a rope,&rdquo; said Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I just can&rsquo;t go away and leave Harry lying
there like that!&rdquo; exclaimed Frank. &ldquo;I just
can&rsquo;t do it. We&rsquo;ve got to get down into that
devil&rsquo;s hole in some way. It may be difficult
but we&rsquo;ve got to do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we could only get over to the other side,&rdquo;
Jack said, &ldquo;we might be able to work our way
down a part of the distance. It seems to me
that the rock is rougher there, and the side not
quite so steep.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">139</div>
<p>&ldquo;It does look that way,&rdquo; Frank answered,
&ldquo;and I think we&rsquo;d better try to get over there.
It will help some, even if we can&rsquo;t get clear to
the bottom. We can at least find out whether
Harry is alive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never leave him lying there, alive or
dead!&rdquo; exclaimed Jack.</p>
<p>The boys at once set out on a difficult journey
toward the far side of the Devil&rsquo;s Punch Bowl.
In many places they had only a rim of rock less
than six inches in diameter for a foot-hold. On
one side, hundreds of feet above them stretched
the snow-covered summit, while on the other
side lay the precipice dipping into the Devil&rsquo;s
Punch Bowl. At last, after great exertion and
very many narrow escapes, the boys reached the
desired location and looked about.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We ought to be able to get down from this
side,&rdquo; Frank said. &ldquo;You stand here at the top
of the rim and let me down arm&rsquo;s length. You
see that shelf there? Oh, it&rsquo;s not more than two
inches wide,&rdquo; the boy went on, as Jack looked
his astonishment, &ldquo;but I can stand on it all
right by leaning against the face of the wall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I can reach that with my toes if you&rsquo;ll
let me down steadily. Then you drop down the
full length of your arms and I&rsquo;ll keep you from
falling when you strike the ledge. There are
other ledges below and so we may be able to get
clear to the bottom.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">140</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid!&rdquo; Jack said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;ll
push you off the ledge when I drop down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to take the chance!&rdquo; Frank returned.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve just got to take the chance,
and that&rsquo;s all there is to it. We can&rsquo;t let
Harry lie there. We&rsquo;re going to get him out,
alive or dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right!&rdquo; Jack said. &ldquo;Drop your legs
inside the pit and catch hold of my hands and
I&rsquo;ll let you down. We can only try!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was indeed a desperate undertaking. The
walls of the Devil&rsquo;s Punch Bowl, as all who have
ever visited that section understand, are almost
perpendicular three-fourths of the way down.
Then they form almost a perfect bowl&mdash;at
least, the bottom of a perfect bowl. In the
center of this bowl lies, or did lie at that time,
a pool of clear, pure water.</p>
<p>For an instant Frank groped blindly, his feet
swinging out into the awful chasm, and then he
found the ledge which he had mentioned. He
looked up to see Jack looking with face red from
exertion over the rim.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">141</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now, chum,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;swing yourself in and
slide down. The eighty per cent slope will
throw your weight away from the pit and I&rsquo;ll
keep you from tumbling backwards when you
strike the ledge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That ledge doesn&rsquo;t look very solid to me,&rdquo;
Jack suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t break it with an axe!&rdquo; replied
Frank. &ldquo;It is safe enough, and the slope will
keep your body on the ledge if you don&rsquo;t get
scared. Now go to it, old boy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Frank talked bravely enough, but he held
his breath as Jack came sliding down. When
the boy&rsquo;s feet struck the ledge, he certainly
would have tumbled backward into the pit if
Frank had not thrown one arm against him.
The boys looked at each other for a moment
without speaking. They fully understood the
peril they were in, yet they tried to be cheerful,
each seeking to belittle the danger to the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There,&rdquo; Frank said lightly, &ldquo;that was easy
enough. We&rsquo;ll never get any medals for doing
an easy stunt like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, it was easy,&rdquo; Jack answered,
&ldquo;and the next ledge is not so far away and is
broader. We&rsquo;ll have to slide down there together
side by side and then if you fall, I can
give you a lift, and you can do the same for me.
I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;re going to have so much
trouble with this old hole after all. Lots of
things look easy after the start.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">142</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s always the way in this gay old world
of ours,&rdquo; Frank answered, &ldquo;all you got to do is
to face a dreaded thing and half its terror is
lost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next ledge was easily reached, but was
not so safe as the other, the edge having crumbled
away to some extent. In fact, the boys
slid off a great deal quicker than they would
otherwise have done, as the rock under their
feet gave indications of dropping.</p>
<p>And so, working their way from ledge to
ledge, sometimes at the peril of their lives,
sometimes finding the way fairly safe and easy,
the boys reached a point not more than twenty
feet from the spot where their unconscious chum
was lying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; Jack said as they stood on the last
ledge and looked into the clear pool below,
&ldquo;we&rsquo;ve got to slide down here like we were going
down a chute. The chances are that we won&rsquo;t
have any neat uniforms when we get to the
bottom, and the possibility is that we&rsquo;ll be good
and wet by the time we make our way out of
that pool.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going into that pool!&rdquo; Frank declared.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s colder than Greenland up here
now, and if we get wet we&rsquo;ll be frozen stiff in
half an hour. We can&rsquo;t do Harry any good by
going to him in a condition calling for nurses
and hot drinks.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">143</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how you&rsquo;re going to help
tumbling into the pool!&rdquo; Jack answered. &ldquo;It
lies not more than twenty feet from the bottom
of the incline.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show you how!&rdquo; Frank declared. &ldquo;All
you&rsquo;ve got to do is to slide down on your little
empty tummy and wear your fingers up to the
second or third joint digging into the rocks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t going to wear out any fingers!&rdquo; Jack
insisted. &ldquo;You remember that great big jack-knife?
The one you said ought to cause my
arrest for carrying concealed weapons? Well,
I&rsquo;ve got that jack-knife with me right now. I&rsquo;m
going to break the big blade off short and dig
into the rock with that all the way down!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you want to break the blade off
for?&rdquo; asked Frank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I can get my hand close to the point of
contact without cutting my fingers off,&rdquo; replied
Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I had a knife like that,&rdquo; Frank said,
regretfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Jack proposed in a moment, &ldquo;we can
bunch in together and each one can have a hand
on the knife. Say, but won&rsquo;t that be a jolly
proposition? Wearing out a perfectly good Boy
Scout uniform on the dirty old rocks of the
Devil&rsquo;s Punch Bowl?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">144</div>
<p>&ldquo;Any way to get down to the bottom!&rdquo; Frank
declared.</p>
<p>The plan figured out by Jack worked to perfection,
and the boys reached the edge of the
pool without tumbling in. Still, however, they
were not within reach of the spot where their
chum was lying.</p>
<p>During all this time, Harry had shown not the
slightest evidence of life. Crumpled up as from
a fatal blow, the boy lay exactly in the position
into which he had fallen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We made the slide on the down-grade, all
right. Now I wish we could slide up over the
spur that separates us from the side of the pool
where Harry is,&rdquo; Jack said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All we&rsquo;ve got to do is to climb,&rdquo; Frank answered.
&ldquo;I never saw any ledge of rock, or
any body of water, or any trouble of any kind,
that you could wish yourself over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the sooner we get there, the better!&rdquo;
Jack declared.</p>
<p>The boys were very pale now, for the time was
near at hand when they were to know the truth
concerning the condition of their chum.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">145</div>
<p>They made their way over the spur which
shot out of the lower wall and down to the pool
with no little difficulty, and at last stood at the
edge of the water where Harry lay, his face
turned upward to the sky, his arms lying limply
at his sides.</p>
<p>The boys hesitated an instant before bending
over him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid!&rdquo; Jack whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid, too!&rdquo; Frank replied, covering for
an instant his face with his hands. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid
he&rsquo;s dead!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Jack bent closer and fixed his eyes
keenly on the boy&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say!&rdquo; he said excitedly. &ldquo;Look here, Frank,
Harry is actually breathing! He may not be
fatally wounded after all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Frank shook his head but hastened to the
pool of water and brought back as much as his
hat would hold. This he threw into the face of
the prostrate boy and then both stood waiting
and watching with their hearts beating wildly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s coming to!&rdquo; shouted Frank in a
moment. &ldquo;He certainly is coming to! Now
what do you think of that after a tumble of a
hundred feet!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It couldn&rsquo;t have been a straight drop!&rdquo;
Jack declared. &ldquo;He would have been smashed
all to flinders!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mention it,&rdquo; Frank cried, &ldquo;you give
me the shivers!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Directly Harry&rsquo;s eyes opened and he looked
painfully about.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">146</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, old Scout!&rdquo; shouted Frank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you getting hungry?&rdquo; demanded Jack.</p>
<p>A faint smile flickered over the face of the
injured lad, and he closed his eyes again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to know something more about
this!&rdquo; Jack insisted. &ldquo;Can you hear, Harry?&rdquo;
he asked after a short pause.</p>
<p>Harry nodded and Jack took him tenderly
by one leg.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yell, when I hurt,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>He moved the limb up and down, sideways,
too, but only a smile came to the boy&rsquo;s lips.
That leg was evidently all right.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now for the other one!&rdquo; Jack declared hopefully.
&ldquo;If I hurt you just give me a kick with
your well hoof!&rdquo;</p>
<p>That leg was all right, too. In a moment,
Harry stirred one arm faintly and then lifted
it to his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And one arm&rsquo;s all right, too!&rdquo; almost shouted
Frank. &ldquo;Say, kid,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;how did
you ever negotiate that tumble and not get
broken into little pieces?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harry opened his eyes again and smiled
faintly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I slid down most of the way,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;My
left arm is broken, and I&rsquo;ve got a bump on my
dome big enough to hide a cow in, but I guess
that&rsquo;s about all. How&rsquo;s that for luck?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">147</div>
<p>&ldquo;Luck?&rdquo; repeated Jack. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;d fall into
the Polar sea, you&rsquo;d find a pot of boiling water!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t believe you&rsquo;re all right except one
broken arm,&rdquo; Frank insisted, &ldquo;until I see you
sitting up and taking notice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harry sat up weakly and looked around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said in a feeble voice, &ldquo;you boys
got down here all right. Now, how are you ever
going to get out?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">148</div>
<h2 id="c14"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XIV</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">A BIT OF ENGINEERING</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, there, Harry!&rdquo; Frank answered.
&ldquo;You stated the question before the
house correctly!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;ll get out some way,&rdquo; Jack insisted.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not going to stay in this little old hole
forever. It&rsquo;s too cold here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you walk, Harry?&rdquo; asked Frank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a short time, probably,&rdquo; was the reply.
&ldquo;While I&rsquo;m resting, you boys chase around and
see if there&rsquo;s any chance of getting back to the
surface of the earth again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Frank and Jack spent some time walking
about the edge of the pool but could find nothing
that looked like an exit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I could turn myself into a barrel of water,&rdquo;
Jack stated with a whimsical smile, &ldquo;I could
run out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and if you could change yourself into a
bird,&rdquo; Frank laughed, &ldquo;you could fly out. But
you&rsquo;re not fluid, and you haven&rsquo;t got wings, so
I guess we&rsquo;ve got to find some other way.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">149</div>
<p>&ldquo;Speaking about water,&rdquo; Jack mused, &ldquo;how
does the water get out of here? It seems to
come from springs in the sides of the pool as
well as from rills down the mountainside when
the snow melts. If it didn&rsquo;t get out in some
way, the Devil&rsquo;s Punch Bowl would simply be a
mountain lake. Perhaps we can get through
the passage made by the water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Following this suggestion, the boys passed
around the pool a number of times always dodging
the handle-like spur which shot into the
basin by turning back, and finally came to a
whirlpool on the east side which showed the drop
in the water. The boys examined the whirl of
water earnestly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is the hole which makes this whirlpool clear
down to the bottom?&rdquo; asked Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t more than four feet from the surface,&rdquo;
answered Frank. &ldquo;It runs in the wall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can see it, can you?&rdquo; asked Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Plainly,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s as large as a
church door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t be safe to dive in there and swim
through, would it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should say not!&rdquo; replied Frank. &ldquo;The
passage is entirely filled by the current and you
couldn&rsquo;t breathe in there more than half a
minute. Besides all that, the swiftness of the
current shows a steep fall and you&rsquo;d probably
bump your head against a rock before you went
a hundred feet. Nothing doing in that line,
kid!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">150</div>
<p>Again and again the boys tramped around
the edge of the pool, stopping whenever they
came to Harry&rsquo;s side to speak words of encouragement,
but all they discovered in the way
of an exit was a crevice which might at one time
have furnished an exit for the waters.</p>
<p>The wash from the rocks, brought down, undoubtedly,
by water from the melting snows, had
apparently lifted the margin of the pool at
least a yard above the mouth of the old crevice,
which was something like a foot in width. This
accumulation of pulverized rock formed a perfect
and complete dam across the mouth of the
opening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a dry exit,&rdquo; Frank exclaimed with a
grim smile. &ldquo;If we could just whittle off a few
pounds of fat, we might be able to get through
there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It dips down pretty fast,&rdquo; Jack answered.
&ldquo;The chances are that we&rsquo;d get about such a
bump as Harry received before we found the
sunshine again. Well, it&rsquo;s not large enough anyway,&rdquo;
he added, &ldquo;so we may as well look for
some other means of egress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While the boy was still standing by the
crevice looking about with hopeful eyes, Frank
caught sight of a moving object on the rim above.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">151</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now, what do you suppose that is?&rdquo; he
asked.</p>
<p>In a moment, Jack&rsquo;s eyes rested on the object,
too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a boy!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;A boy all right
enough, and it&rsquo;s peaches to prunes that he&rsquo;s the
chap who&rsquo;s been playing villain ever since we
came into the mountains. I wish he had with
him the rope that he will eventually be hanged
with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; replied Frank with a grimace.
&ldquo;Keep it dark! Don&rsquo;t you ever tell him that
he&rsquo;s going to be hanged. If you do, he won&rsquo;t
ever help us out of this blooming old punch
bowl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy stood looking down into the bowl
for a moment, listening to the shouts for assistance
which the boys now sent up, made a few
quick signals, and turned away.</p>
<p>As the reader understands, the assistance
Norman sought to give the boys could best be
rendered by seeking their friends and informing
them of the situation. Jack and Frank were,
of course, greatly enraged at the boy&rsquo;s seemingly
heartless desertion of them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now what do you think of that for a cold-blooded
reptile?&rdquo; demanded Jack. &ldquo;That fellow
certainly is the limit!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">152</div>
<p>&ldquo;You just wait,&rdquo; Frank shouted, almost dancing
about in his anger, &ldquo;you just wait till I get
my hands on that gink. I&rsquo;ll change his face
so his friends won&rsquo;t know him. The idea of his
going off and leaving us in such a fix as this!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s rotten!&rdquo; Jack agreed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rotten?&rdquo; echoed Frank, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s worse than
rotten! It&rsquo;s stinking mean!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which reminds me,&rdquo; Jack went on, &ldquo;that if
we ever get out of here we&rsquo;ve got to accomplish
the exit by our own exertions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You talk like you had a suggestion to make,&rdquo;
Frank declared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have!&rdquo; answered Jack. &ldquo;You see that
crevice in the edge of the Punch Bowl, don&rsquo;t
you? Well, that used to carry away the waters
of the pool. Some day the water became
stuffed with sand and the pool found another
way out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I begin to understand!&rdquo; Frank exclaimed.
&ldquo;I think I know what you mean. You have an
idea that we can restore the water to its old
channel and creep out through the larger passage,
like the Egyptians crossing the Red Sea
without getting their feet wet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the idea,&rdquo; Jack exclaimed, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s
just the idea! Only the Egyptians didn&rsquo;t cross
the Red Sea without getting their feet wet. It
was the Hebrew children who crossed between
two vertical walls of water. The Egyptians got
theirs right there in the mud!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">153</div>
<p>&ldquo;Have it your own way,&rdquo; Frank laughed.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I don&rsquo;t remember my Sunday School
lessons very well. Have it your own way, only
plan some escape from this everlasting pit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just as I was about to say when you interrupted
with your fake story about the Egyptian
army,&rdquo; Jack went on, &ldquo;we may be able in time
to cut through the natural levee that separates
the waters of the pool from the old channel. If
we can, we can draw the water out of the present
exit and use it for our own escape.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the idea!&rdquo; Frank declared.</p>
<p>The two boys now made a closer inspection
of the natural levee and the mouth of the crevice.
They discovered that by cutting through a
couple of feet of sand, the distance being about
ten feet, they could, indeed, turn the waters of
the pool into its old channel.</p>
<p>Of course this would not provide a depth of
channel sufficient to empty the pool, but they
believed that, with the natural wash of the
current, the surface might be lowered so that
water would no longer find its way into the large
opening.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">154</div>
<p>Working with such bits of sharp-edged shale
as they could find, the boys fell to their task
without delay. Harry, observing their industry
from a distance, smiled happily at the thought
that the boys had at least found a way out
which was worth considering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we just had a couple of shovels like those
muckers use over on the East river,&rdquo; Jack said,
wiping the sweat from his forehead with the
sleeve of his jacket, &ldquo;we could cut through this
obstruction in about five minutes. This is a
fierce game!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m getting so I like these strenuous moments,&rdquo;
Frank declared, putting both hands to
his aching back. &ldquo;The fact of the matter is,&rdquo;
he went on, &ldquo;that I&rsquo;d rather be at work draining
the Devil&rsquo;s Punch Bowl than playing the part of
a little sissy cigar-store boy in New York.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you like it!&rdquo; Jack replied, sourly.</p>
<p>It was almost dark when at last the trench
was completed. It was with great satisfaction
that the boys saw the water trickle into the new
channel and find its way to the crevice. As the
current grew stronger, it washed the banks away,
and in a very short time a roaring torrent was
rushing into the old outlet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the idea!&rdquo; Frank exclaimed. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
a head of water here that ought to cut that
channel six feet deep,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;And that
will give us a dry tunnel to walk out of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To walk into,&rdquo; corrected Jack. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t
know whether we&rsquo;ll ever walk out of it or not.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">155</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you needn&rsquo;t tell that to Harry!&rdquo; exclaimed
Frank reproachfully. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to
make him believe that it&rsquo;s a sure thing we can
get him out of this rotten old excavation in the
hills.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we&rsquo;re going to do it, too!&rdquo; declared
Jack. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know just how we&rsquo;re going to
do it, but we&rsquo;re going to do it! The channel
will soon be dry enough for us to investigate,
and somewhere is better than nowhere&mdash;by
which I mean this hole in the rocks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hearing the rushing water, Harry arose to a
sitting position and looked over toward his
chums with a smile on his pale face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew you could do it!&rdquo; he shouted, still in
a faint voice. &ldquo;I knew you would find a way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You bet we&rsquo;ll find a way!&rdquo; Jack answered.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been in worse holes than this and always
got out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now you&rsquo;ve said something!&rdquo; Frank declared.</p>
<p>The boys watched the running water, every
moment gaining in force, for a long time, and
then, just as the last rays of the sun touched the
snowy mantle of the mountain, the water passed
below the level of a large opening and they saw
it drying out.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">156</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what Grant did at Vicksburg,&rdquo;
Frank laughed. &ldquo;When he found the water
occupying the channel he wanted to use himself,
he just turned it to one side.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s exactly what we&rsquo;ve done here,&rdquo; Jack
agreed, &ldquo;but now that we have turned it aside,
there&rsquo;s a question as to whether we can make the
same use of the channel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The only way to find out is to go to it,&rdquo;
Frank advised. &ldquo;Did those ginks take away
your searchlight?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They did not,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;They took
away my revolver and looked at the searchlight,
but the latter they passed back to me because it
seemed to be worthless as a weapon and bulky
to carry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got mine, too,&rdquo; Frank said, &ldquo;if it isn&rsquo;t
smashed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys examined their electrics with great
care, and, to their great satisfaction, found that
they were still fit for use.</p>
<p>It was now so dark that the lights were
actually needed in the pit, still they did not turn
them on, fearful that the boy who had shown
himself for an instant and then disappeared
might return with the half-breeds.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">157</div>
<p>&ldquo;The first thing to do,&rdquo; Jack suggested, &ldquo;is
to bring Harry over to the mouth of this dry
channel. You see,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve got to
investigate the place before we attempt to carry
him in, and he&rsquo;ll feel better if we place him where
he can hear our voices and see our lights. I
guess we can carry him so as not to cause him
suffering or injure his bruises.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just bet he can walk over,&rdquo; Frank declared.
&ldquo;Anyway, I know he won&rsquo;t like the
idea of being carried around like a baby.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On being consulted upon the point, Harry
declared that he could walk just as well as not,
and walk he did, although his steps were rather
shaky at first. The entrance to the tunnel was
quite large, tapering away as it mined the hill.
Into this large outer chamber, for such it virtually
was, Harry was seated with one of the
searchlights for company, and Frank and Jack
proceeded on their tour of investigation.</p>
<p>For the first few feet they were able to walk
with their backs only slightly bent but then they
advanced slowly on their hands and knees.
When at last they reached a steep declivity
extending, apparently, far into the heart of the
mountain, they turned back and brought the
wounded boy up to that place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now keep your light covered,&rdquo; Jack advised,
&ldquo;and if anyone comes down to the pit led
by that thief of a boy messenger, they will
naturally think we had made a get-away.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">158</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going down this long incline,&rdquo; Frank
went on, &ldquo;and when we get to the bottom, if
everything is clear, we&rsquo;re coming back after
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a time the voices and lights of the boys
supplied companionship for the wounded lad,
then they were heard and seen no more.</p>
<p>Harry waited for a long time for some sign
of the return of his friends, but they did not
come and he feared the worst.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">159</div>
<h2 id="c15"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XV</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE TROUBLES OF GILROY</span></h2>
<p>Following carefully the directions given them
by Norman, Ned and Jimmie toiled up the slope
until they came to the summit of the ridge
which lay along the side of the Sierra Nevadas
and then turned to the north. The way was
steep and rocky, but in their anxiety and excitement
they made good progress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The boy may be lying,&rdquo; Ned replied in answer
to Jimmie&rsquo;s question, &ldquo;but we can&rsquo;t take
that for granted. We&rsquo;ve just got to go and see
if the boys are in such a predicament as he described.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At first,&rdquo; Jimmie announced, &ldquo;I had rather
a good opinion of Norman. But lately I&rsquo;ve been
thinking over all the tricks he has played on us,
and I&rsquo;m becoming convinced that he is a bad
egg.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">160</div>
<p>&ldquo;The record does look rather black,&rdquo; Ned
answered. &ldquo;Every time we have listened to advice
or suggestions from him, we have gotten
into trouble. He has always told a good story,
and we have always had the worst of it. If this
proves true in the present case, we will settle
with him the next time he comes across our
path.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t suppose they&rsquo;ll go to the camp and
stir up Gilroy, do you?&rdquo; asked Jimmie after a
long time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If they do, he&rsquo;ll be scared out of his skin!&rdquo;
Ned laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What made me ask,&rdquo; Jimmie went on, &ldquo;is
that I saw lights flashing back there, and I
thought I heard some one calling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must be mistaken!&rdquo; Ned insisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now just come over here and look for yourself,&rdquo;
Jimmie answered. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s an elevation,
something like the one I stood on when I saw
the commotion and heard the voice at the camp.
Come on over and see what you can make of
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ned stepped to the elevation occupied by
his chum and looked out over the slope of the
mountain. From where he stood the entrance
to the cave was not in sight, it being concealed
by the dip of the rock in which the cavern lay.
However, a short distance up the slope, he saw
a light moving and heard the call of a frightened
voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; Jimmie exclaimed triumphantly.
&ldquo;What do you make of that?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">161</div>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps the boys have returned,&rdquo; suggested
Ned. &ldquo;Perhaps they are calling to us now not
to wander off in search of them. Suppose we
wait here a minute and see?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That ain&rsquo;t any of our boys putting up a
roar like that!&rdquo; Jimmie insisted. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet a
dollar it&rsquo;s that fat old confidential clerk. Say,
Ned!&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;that fellow has got more
screech in him than any full-grown man I ever
saw. Do you mind how he cut the air with his
agony when the bear had him up the tree?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It certainly is Gilroy!&rdquo; Ned exclaimed impatiently.
&ldquo;Now, what do you suppose sent
him up here after us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He probably found himself alone,&rdquo; suggested
Jimmie, &ldquo;and wandering out, saw our light. I
remember of flashing one when we passed around
that big boulder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s coming on like an insane man!&rdquo; said
Ned angrily. &ldquo;If there&rsquo;s an enemy within ten
miles of us, he will have no difficulty in locating
us after this. I wish I could stop him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ned did not in the least overstate the case
when he said that Gilroy was coming on like an
insane person. After finding himself alone in
the cave, the fat clerk had seized a searchlight
and dashed out in quest of the boys. As Jimmie
had suggested, he had seen a flash of light up the
slope and followed on.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">162</div>
<p>As he advanced now, puffing so that his approach
might be heard many rods away, he
swung the light frantically in the air and called
out at the top of his voice. With an exclamation
of impatience, Ned turned on his own light
and ran toward him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep still!&rdquo; he shouted as soon as the voice
of the clerk gave him an opportunity to cut in.
&ldquo;Keep still, I tell you! You&rsquo;ll have every
robber and murderer in the mountain down on
us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now it&rsquo;s robbers and murderers, is it?&rdquo;
shrieked the clerk. &ldquo;It was bears and panthers
down in the cave. I saw a bear sneaking up to
the provision box just as I left. He seemed to
want to eat me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>By this time Jimmie had joined the two, and
now stood with a grin on his freckled face,
rather enjoying the situation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you chased off and left him chewing up
our grub, did you?&rdquo; he demanded. &ldquo;What are
we going to eat tomorrow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh my! oh my!&rdquo; wailed Gilroy. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
believe there will ever be any tomorrow. Once
I get out of this brutal country, I&rsquo;ll never leave
New York again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are we going to do with him, Ned?&rdquo;
asked Jimmie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s simply got to go back to the cave,&rdquo; Ned
answered. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t have him with us at a
time like this.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">163</div>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t go back to the cave!&rdquo; shouted Gilroy,
again brandishing his searchlight in the air. &ldquo;I
won&rsquo;t go back to the cave alone!&rdquo; he continued.
&ldquo;If you insist on my leaving you, I&rsquo;ll start afoot
over the mountains for San Francisco.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you should do a fool thing like that,&rdquo;
Jimmie declared, &ldquo;the bears would have a
beautiful feast of fat clerk before morning!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t go back to the cave, I just won&rsquo;t!&rdquo;
insisted Gilroy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Ned said hesitatingly, &ldquo;if you&rsquo;ll keep
your eyes open and your mouth closed, and hand
me that light so you won&rsquo;t be showing it every
second, you may come along with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gilroy meekly handed over the electric, and
the three proceeded on their way, Ned walking
close to the fat clerk in order to ensure his
silence. Jimmie trailed along with a grin on his
face.</p>
<p>Finally Ned paused and pointed to two
parallel ridges to the north.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;unless I am very much
mistaken, are the ridges which stand on either
side of the Devil&rsquo;s Punch Bowl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ll soon know whether that messenger
is a liar or not,&rdquo; Jimmie stated. &ldquo;He
may be all right, but, just the same, I&rsquo;m looking
for some one to butt in on us every minute now!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">164</div>
<p>They were not molested, however, as they
walked along, winding into gulches, climbing
to the top of crags, and occasionally making
their way over narrow ledges. Gilroy actually
shivered as the boys forced him along, sometimes
leading him by the arm, at other times pushing
him along with many sly winks and chuckles.</p>
<p>There was only the light of the stars, but the
ridges were clearly outlined because of the
stretches of snow which cloaked them.</p>
<p>At last they came to the verge of the pit and
looked down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the place, sure enough!&rdquo; Ned decided.
&ldquo;Unless the boy who gave the information
is an accomplished liar, we ought to find
our chums at the bottom of this wicked old
precipice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gilroy stood for a moment trembling on the
edge of the cavern and then almost dropped back
into Ned&rsquo;s arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll never get down there, never!&rdquo; he
wailed. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll drop off into space and never
see the Great White Way again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go to it, partner!&rdquo; grinned Jimmie, not a
little disgusted at the lack of physical courage
exhibited by the fat clerk. &ldquo;Get your troubles
all off your chest and then cheer up. The worst
is yet to come!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">165</div>
<p>Gilroy sat flat down at the lip of the Devil&rsquo;s
Punch Bowl and almost sobbed out his grief
and fright.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I ever get out of this rotten old country,&rdquo;
he declared, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll lock myself up in a steam-heated
flat, and remain there as long as I live!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leaving the fat clerk bewailing his fate,
Jimmie made his way to where Ned was standing,
looking anxiously down into the depression.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you see anything of the boys?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a thing,&rdquo; Ned replied. &ldquo;The fact of
the matter is,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;that we couldn&rsquo;t
distinguish a flock of white elephants down
there. It&rsquo;s darker than a pocket!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then what are we going to do?&rdquo; demanded
Jimmie. &ldquo;The boy didn&rsquo;t lie about the locality,
but it may be that he lied about the lads
being here. Anyway,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve got
to make our way down this wicked old drop and
find out whether they&rsquo;re here or not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The narrow ledges down which Jack and
Frank had made their way were now out of
sight because of the darkness. In fact, to the
boys looking into the black hole from above,
there seemed no possible way of entering the
place where they believed their chums to be.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">166</div>
<p>While they stood there, wondering how the
downward journey was to be made in safety
even with the rope, the round eye of an electric
searchlight became visible at the mouth of the
channel from which the water had been led away.
Jimmie pointed to it eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are there!&rdquo; he cried excitedly. &ldquo;There
they are, sure enough!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be the boys,&rdquo; Ned replied, &ldquo;because
that finger of light comes from an electric torchlight,
and, so far as I know, we are the only
ones having them here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then this Norman kid told the truth for
once in his life!&rdquo; Jimmie admitted. &ldquo;If he
really has directed us to the assistance of our
friends I&rsquo;ll forgive him all the mean things he
ever did to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Ned said in a moment, &ldquo;we can now
try the rope. We don&rsquo;t know whether it is long
enough to reach the bottom or not, but it will
at least bring us nearer to our chums. I don&rsquo;t
half like the idea of going down in the darkness,
because there&rsquo;s no knowing what we may run
into, but it&rsquo;s got to be done all the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me go!&rdquo; exclaimed Jimmie excitedly.
&ldquo;You and Gilroy can stay here and handle the
rope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you always get lost, little boy!&rdquo; Ned
said with a chuckle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how I&rsquo;m ever going to get lost
in the bottom of a dip like that,&rdquo; Jimmie answered.
&ldquo;From what I can see of it, it looks
about like the bottom of an old brass kettle.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">167</div>
<p>After listening to the conversation of the boys
for a moment, and reaching the conclusion that
he would be required to drop into the dark pit
with the others, Gilroy now sprang to his feet
and approached Ned with trembling footsteps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;T can&rsquo;t get down there!&rdquo; he almost shouted.
&ldquo;My arms are weak, and my shoulders are lame,
and I never could hang onto the rope. I should
fall and be crushed to a pulp on the rocks below!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here, Gilroy!&rdquo; Ned said angrily. &ldquo;You
must remember that we have troubles of our
own. If you don&rsquo;t want to go with us, perhaps
you may be able to find your way back to camp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never, never, never!&rdquo; cried the fat confidential
clerk. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I tell you that I left
a bear at the camp?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Ned argued with the fellow, &ldquo;you and
I will lower Jimmie into the hole. Then you
can lower me and wait until we get ready to come
back. I&rsquo;ll leave a revolver and searchlight with
you, only you mustn&rsquo;t do any shooting, and you
mustn&rsquo;t show the light under any circumstances.
It would be dangerous to do so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be sure to come back?&rdquo; pleaded Gilroy.
&ldquo;It would be a wicked thing to do to
leave me here in the darkness!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw, of course we&rsquo;ll come back!&rdquo; interrupted
Jimmie. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to come back, for there&rsquo;s
no other way to get out of the gloomy old den.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">168</div>
<p>Gilroy seemed to be more cheerful over this
arrangement, and assisted quite capably in
lowering Jimmie over the lip of the precipice.
The two passed out the rope to the boy dangling
at the lower end until the cord was almost entirely
unwound. Then a call from below announced
toe them that the lad had found footing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now then,&rdquo; Ned explained to the confidential
clerk, &ldquo;when the rope is drawn up, you
lie down on your stomach on the other side of
the ledge so that you may by no possibility be
drawn down. Pay out the rope slowly till I
tell you that I have reached bottom and then
leave it dangling over the edge. We may have
to make a quick jump for it, you know,&rdquo; he
added. &ldquo;In that case, we want it handy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gilroy&rsquo;s teeth fairly chattered at the thought
of being left alone with such a responsibility,
but he said nothing, and Ned soon stood by
Jimmie&rsquo;s side at the bottom of the precipice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you seen any more lights?&rdquo; the boy
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nary a light,&rdquo; was the reply, &ldquo;but I thought
once that I heard voices coming from the spot in
which the illumination was seen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we may as well be moving in that direction,&rdquo;
Ned observed, and directly the two
boys found themselves gazing at the opening
from which the water had been recently drained.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">169</div>
<h2 id="c16"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XVI</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">A FALL IN THE NIGHT</span></h2>
<p>Becoming too anxious for the safety of his
friends to remain seated in the position in which
he had been left, Harry at last arose to his feet
and advanced down the passage toward the
incline where they had disappeared. He could
see nothing, and presently turned back.</p>
<p>Instead of sitting down again, he moved
back, always painfully because of his broken
arm, toward the entrance to the old tunnel.
He remembered faintly that Jack and Frank had
called out to some one at the top of the pit during
the afternoon, and his hope was now that
whoever had visited the place and witnessed
their plight would return.</p>
<p>He reached the entrance and flashed his light
about eagerly. No one was in sight and he
turned back disheartened. Had he known that
the finger of light from the electric had been
seen by Ned and Jimmie, he would have returned
to his old position with a much lighter
heart.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">170</div>
<p>The discouraged boy sat down at the head of
the incline to once more watch and listen for the
return of his chums. His broken arm was now
becoming very painful, and at last he turned on
the electric with a view of rearranging the rough
sling in which Frank and Jack had placed it.</p>
<p>The boys had been too anxious at the moment
of reaching the bottom of the pit to attempt the
setting of the limb at that time. They might
have done so had they realized that an hour or
two must elapse before they could reach a place
more suitable for the undertaking.</p>
<p>The instant the boy turned on the light, he
heard a shout from the rear, and turning, he
saw two flashlights moving toward him. At
first the figures behind the lights were not discernible,
but as they came nearer he recognized
the forms of Ned and Jimmie. The boys approached
him almost gaily. Norman had reported
Harry lying inertly at the bottom of the
Devil&rsquo;s Punch Bowl, and they had in a measure
prepared their minds to find the boy dead or
fatally injured.</p>
<p>So, when they saw him leaning against the
wall of the old channel, arranging the handkerchief
sling which sustained his broken arm, they
almost shouted with joy. In a moment they
were at his side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hiding, eh?&rdquo; exclaimed Jimmie, his voice almost
choking with emotion. &ldquo;You thought we
couldn&rsquo;t find you, did you?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">171</div>
<p>&ldquo;Are you badly hurt?&rdquo; was Ned&rsquo;s first
question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just a broken arm,&rdquo; Harry answered trying
to speak very calmly, although the pain was now
excruciating.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are Frank and Jack?&rdquo; was the next
question.</p>
<p>Harry pointed toward the sloping passage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trying to find a way out,&rdquo; he answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Were they here when you fell?&rdquo; asked
Jimmie. &ldquo;If they were, why didn&rsquo;t they set
your broken arm? They understand first aid
to the injured just as well as we do. Now, you
drop right back on this nice, soft bed of granite
and I&rsquo;ll see if I can find something that will
serve for splints. There ought to be something
that can be used floating in the water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw tree branches bobbing about there this
afternoon,&rdquo; Harry said, very faintly. &ldquo;You
may be able to find what you want.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jimmie darted away toward the entrance,
and Ned began removing the bandage and the
boy&rsquo;s coat and shirtsleeve. His face brightened
as he came to understand the extent of the injury.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was afraid of a compound fracture,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;but this is all right. The flesh is badly
swollen, but we&rsquo;ll soon drive that away. Is it
very painful?&rdquo; he continued.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">172</div>
<p>&ldquo;It hurts like the dickens!&rdquo; almost sobbed
Harry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t the boys fix it?&rdquo; demanded Ned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; answered Harry, &ldquo;someone came
to the edge of the pit and called down, and then
ran away without giving us any help. We were
all afraid he had gone away after some of the
half-breeds, and so it seemed that the first thing
to do was to get out of sight. After we got in
here, they thought they could find their way
out by following this tunnel and get to the
camp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a short time Jimmie returned with several
pieces of wood from which splints were made,
and then the boy&rsquo;s arm was tenderly cared for.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; Ned exclaimed at the conclusion of
the operation, &ldquo;now you&rsquo;ll be all right in just no
time!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good thing we&rsquo;re all Boy Scouts, eh?&rdquo;
Jimmie chuckled. &ldquo;And it&rsquo;s a good thing, too,
that one part of the education of a Boy Scout
is the care of the injured.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never realized before what an advantage
it is,&rdquo; Harry said with a faint smile. &ldquo;I was
beginning to think I&rsquo;d have to remain here all
night with the broken bones of that arm grinding
together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it about time Jack and Frank were
coming back?&rdquo; asked Ned.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">173</div>
<p>&ldquo;They should have been here long ago,&rdquo;
replied Harry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope they haven&rsquo;t met with any accident,&rdquo;
Jimmie put in. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what I&rsquo;ll do,&rdquo;
he went on, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just take a slide down that incline
and see if I can dig &rsquo;em up anywhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you&rsquo;d better let me go,&rdquo; Ned advised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw,&rdquo; Jimmie complained, &ldquo;you always want
to cop out all the fun!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, go on, then,&rdquo; Ned laughed. &ldquo;If you
bump your head against a rock, or get dumped
into a pool of water something like the one out
there, you mustn&rsquo;t blame me. Remember that
I wanted to go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jimmie approached the long incline, his
electric pointing the way, and soon shouted
back:</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is all right! There&rsquo;s a turn here, and
the going is good. Come on in, you fellows.
Mighty fine in here!&rdquo; he went on.</p>
<p>Ned and Harry, the latter now fairly free from
pain, made their way slowly to where Jimmie sat
hunched up against the side of the wall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cripes!&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;what makes it so
wet in here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Harry explained how the old channel
had been cleared of water.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">174</div>
<p>&ldquo;The boys must have been going some,&rdquo;
Jimmie put in. &ldquo;But look here,&rdquo; he went on,
&ldquo;suppose that old crevice you are talking about
should clog or something of that kind? We&rsquo;d
be in a nice mixup down here, wouldn&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Judging from the noise the water was making
in getting out of the pool,&rdquo; Ned suggested, &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s much show for the channel
clogging. Our only danger from water is that
outlaws may dam the present current and flood
this channel once more. I don&rsquo;t think there are
any outlaws within a mile of us, but still, there&rsquo;s
always a chance of their having been summoned
by the boy you saw this afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here!&rdquo; Jimmie observed. &ldquo;The boy
they saw this afternoon is probably the one who
came to the camp and told us where you were.
I don&rsquo;t believe he&rsquo;d bring any outlaws here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not unless the outlaws desired to bag us
all in one bunch,&rdquo; Harry added with a smile.
&ldquo;That may be the idea, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My,&rdquo; chuckled Jimmie, &ldquo;wouldn&rsquo;t Gilroy
throw a fit if the outlaws should come and find
him sitting there holding the rope? I honestly
believe that he&rsquo;d drop dead with fright.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe I&rsquo;ll take a walk&mdash;or a crawl,
rather&mdash;out to the mouth of this damp old
aqueduct and see what the fat confidential clerk
is doing,&rdquo; suggested Ned.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">175</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet you the Michigan Central Railroad
against the Pennsylvania system,&rdquo; Jimmie
chuckled, &ldquo;that Gilroy has his little old electric
lamp trimmed and burning when you get there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ned did not offer to accept the wager, but
turned and made his way around the corner and
up the long incline. Just as he reached the
entrance a cry of terror came to his ears, followed
almost immediately by a pistol shot and
the fall of a heavy body.</p>
<p>Ned shivered as the unseen form thudded
down the awful precipice, bounding, apparently,
from one tiny ledge to another, and finally came,
with a sickening crash, to the bottom! Only for
an instant, however, did it lay on the rocks.
There was a splash in the pool and then silence.</p>
<p>Almost shivering with dread, fearing that
Gilroy had been shot and hurled from the lip
of the cliff, Ned leaned against the wall and
waited.</p>
<p>For a time there was no sound at all, and then
came a succession of noises which indicated that
some one was moving about at the top of the
pool so close to the edge that stones dislodged
by their feet were bumping down the incline.
As the sounds came from two or three directions
at once, the boy naturally concluded that the
Devil&rsquo;s Punch Bowl was fairly well surrounded.
He looked long in the hope of discovering a
light or a figure moving dimly against the expanse
of stars, but nothing was seen.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">176</div>
<p>The shot had attracted the attention of the
boys in the passage, and Jimmie now came
panting out to his chum&rsquo;s side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; he asked almost breathlessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was a shot!&rdquo; Ned answered. &ldquo;And
some one fell into the pit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must have been Gilroy, then!&rdquo; Jimmie
suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid so,&rdquo; was Ned&rsquo;s anxious reply.</p>
<p>Jimmie listened for a short time and then
started away, but Ned drew him back into
the shelter of the opening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remain where you are!&rdquo; he whispered.
&ldquo;There are people moving all around the dip.
They may try to come down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So that foxy little messenger boy did give
us away, did he?&rdquo; asked Jimmie. &ldquo;I thought
he would all the time!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know yet whether he did or not,&rdquo;
Ned answered, still in a whisper. &ldquo;The boy
might have been followed when he came here,
you know. I can&rsquo;t believe yet that he intentionally
led us into danger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He always has!&rdquo; argued Jimmie.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">177</div>
<p>In a moment the rattle of stones was heard
again, followed by an exclamation of dismay and
a fall. It was such a fall as Ned had heard before&mdash;a
long, bounding, awful fall, with a sickening
crash as of broken flesh and bones at the
last!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Je-rusalem!&rdquo; whispered Jimmie. &ldquo;I should
think they&rsquo;d get tired of that after a while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I knew where Gilroy is,&rdquo; Ned commented.
&ldquo;I heard him cry out in alarm just
before the shot came, then followed the tumble
from the top. I&rsquo;m afraid it&rsquo;s all up with Gilroy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should say it was all down with Gilroy if
he tipped off that ledge,&rdquo; Jimmie commented.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Young man,&rdquo; Ned said, &ldquo;this is too serious
a matter to joke about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyway,&rdquo; Jimmie continued, facetiously,
&ldquo;they wouldn&rsquo;t have to shoot Gilroy to get him
rolling down the incline. All they&rsquo;d have to do
would be to poke a finger and yell &lsquo;scat!&rsquo; and
away he&rsquo;d go. Honest, Ned,&rdquo; the boy continued,
a little ashamed of his lack of reverence,
&ldquo;that Gilroy is the limit when it comes to getting
scared!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must remember,&rdquo; Ned observed, &ldquo;that
this is all new to Gilroy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All new!&rdquo; repeated Jimmie. &ldquo;I should say
so. That fellow doesn&rsquo;t know any more about
rough-house than a pig knows about the tariff
issue. Actually, Ned, I don&rsquo;t believe he could
rough-house a baby cart.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">178</div>
<p>While the boys were talking a faint light appeared
at the top of the incline to the east. It
wavered about aimlessly for a moment and then
passed from view. It was not such a light as
would be thrown by an electric torch but rather
indicated the flaring of a match in the wind.</p>
<p>Two shots followed the showing of the tiny
light, and then a perfect shower of stones rolled
down the incline and splashed into the pool at
the bottom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee!&rdquo; whispered Jimmie. &ldquo;If I ever get
back to little old N. Y., I&rsquo;m going to have a
friend of mine paint this scene for a back-drop
in the Devil&rsquo;s auction! Wouldn&rsquo;t it make a
hit?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jimmie,&rdquo; Ned reprimanded, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like sometime
to see you plunged into a set of circumstances
which would throw you into a serious
mood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw, what&rsquo;s the use?&rdquo; Jimmie returned.
&ldquo;All the wind-jamming I do here won&rsquo;t make
any difference with what&rsquo;s going on out there on
the pit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d feel a good deal safer,&rdquo; Ned said in a
moment, &ldquo;if I knew that Frank and Jack were
safe. I am beginning to fear that they found an
exit through the old passage, and, rather than
make their way back up the incline, returned
to the pit up the slope.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">179</div>
<p>&ldquo;I never thought of that,&rdquo; Jimmie answered
very gravely. &ldquo;Here I&rsquo;ve been shooting off hot
air at what&rsquo;s going on, and Frank and Jack may
be the ones who are getting the kibosh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the boy ceased speaking, a bumping, swishing
sound was heard, and then footsteps sounded
in the pit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; Jimmie exclaimed. &ldquo;Some one has
come down the rope! Now, who is it? One of
the boys, Gilroy or a half-breed?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">180</div>
<h2 id="c17"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XVII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">A WONDERFUL DISCOVERY</span></h2>
<p>Frank and Jack, when they left Harry near
the entrance to the old channel, passed down the
incline afterwards followed by their chum and
presently came to the turn in the passage. Here
they paused for a moment to take note of the
situation, and then passed down another incline,
much steeper than the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The water must have been going some when
it reached this point,&rdquo; Frank suggested. &ldquo;Put
in one straight drop, these tunnels would make
Niagara look like thirty cents.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish it had worn a little larger passage,&rdquo;
Jack complained, sourly, crawling head foremost
into the narrow passage, his flashlight held
in advance. &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t it be fun seeing Gilroy
trying to crowd through here,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;You
could hear him puff for a mile!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This last steep incline brought the boys to
quite a large chamber in the rock. Their lights
showed glistening spots in the wall, and they
naturally stepped to examine them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gold!&rdquo; shouted Jack in a moment.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">181</div>
<p>&ldquo;You bet it&rsquo;s gold!&rdquo; Frank declared. &ldquo;I
guess I know gold when I see it. Look at it all
around us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is my firm belief,&rdquo; Jack almost shouted,
&ldquo;that we have struck the mother lode! This is
the spot where the gold that is washed out in the
placers comes from. Don&rsquo;t you think so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may be,&rdquo; answered Frank, &ldquo;and I don&rsquo;t
wonder that the corporations at war with your
father&rsquo;s company are fighting for this hill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe they even know this gold is
here,&rdquo; Jack suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They may not know of this special deposit
of gold,&rdquo; Frank continued, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ll tell you
right now that they do know of a lot of other deposits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Jack returned, &ldquo;if they didn&rsquo;t know
there was gold here in plenty, they wouldn&rsquo;t be
putting up such a scrap for the possession of
the land. Corporations don&rsquo;t fight for stone
piles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys looked over every foot of the
chamber, estimating the amount of virgin gold
in sight, and almost unconsciously looking for
some evidence that the place had been visited
before their arrival. Before long Frank stumbled
over a slight obstruction on the level floor of the
chamber, and almost fell to his knees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What the dickens is coming off here?&rdquo; he
shouted.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">182</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; warned Jack. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the use of
asking the question of the wide, wide world?
We don&rsquo;t know who may be within sound of our
voices.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One thing I do know,&rdquo; Frank grumbled,
&ldquo;and that is that I just about busted my big
toe! Now what do you suppose that is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stooped as he spoke and lifted what seemed
to be a very crude iron pick from the floor. It
was nearly a foot in length, with two sharp
points, and in the eye between the two, at the
center of the implement, were the remains of a
wooden handle, rotted away during long years
of disuse. The boys eyed it curiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s that for a prehistoric implement?&rdquo;
asked Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks as though it might be five thousand
years old,&rdquo; Frank answered, taking the implement
into his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks to me,&rdquo; Jack declared, &ldquo;like one of
the cave-dweller tools one sees in the Smithsonian
Institute at Washington. The scientists
declare that such implements were used in the
crude mining carried on thousands of years ago.
They also state that they were used for beating
up Indian corn and refractory wives.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">183</div>
<p>&ldquo;Anyway,&rdquo; Frank laughed, &ldquo;the presence of
the tool here shows that this chamber was
never formed by the action of the water. Those
old duffers hewed this out, gathering gold, with
just such tools as this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And they probably found a good many
pounds of gold in every square foot they dug
out!&rdquo; replied Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, look here,&rdquo; Frank said, &ldquo;if they
hewed out this chamber, they built the dam over
the old crevice which turned the water into this
channel. Can you imagine a better way of
concealing millions of dollars worth of gold?
I guess they were next to their jobs, all right!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what it is,&rdquo; Jack laughed, &ldquo;when
we get back to New York and tell Dad what
we&rsquo;ve discovered, he ought to buy us a transcontinental
railroad apiece. We&rsquo;ve earned it
all right!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Frank looked back toward the narrow incline,
and again cast his searchlight over the
chamber, which now seemed to them to be a
perfect treasure house of virgin gold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did it ever occur to you,&rdquo; he said grimly,
&ldquo;that we&rsquo;ve got to get out of this mess before
we get back to New York?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Jack replied, &ldquo;and we&rsquo;ve got to make
our way out through the continuation of this
passage. We couldn&rsquo;t crawl back up that steep
passage in a thousand years!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">184</div>
<p>&ldquo;And Harry lays back there with a broken
arm,&rdquo; Jack added ruefully. &ldquo;We should have
taken the time to give the boy a little &lsquo;first-aid&rsquo;
before we started out on this excursion. He
must be suffering.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then the thing for us to do now is to keep
plugging along until we get out into God&rsquo;s free
air again. If we can get out ourselves, we can
go back to camp and get a coil of rope and boost
Harry out over the edge of the pit. We never
could get him through this tunnel anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the ticket!&rdquo; Jack answered.</p>
<p>A narrow opening led from the chamber in
which the boys had discovered the gold, and
they followed this for a short distance only to
find themselves confronted by a solid wall of
rock. The tunnel seemed to end there!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; questioned Frank, &ldquo;how did the
water find its way out of this contraption?
There must be a channel somewhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack lowered his electric to the floor of the
passage and then looked up to his chum with
positive fright showing in his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It went plumb down into a hole in the rock!&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the hole and it isn&rsquo;t large
enough for a good sized terrier to crawl through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Talk about getting up against the real
thing!&rdquo; grumbled Frank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now you just wait a minute,&rdquo; Jack suggested.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a current of air here that
doesn&rsquo;t come through the passage by which we
entered. It blows directly from the north.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">185</div>
<p>Eagerly the boys turned their lights toward
the north wall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here you are!&rdquo; Frank shouted in a moment.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s another passage here and it&rsquo;s been
blocked up with stones! The cement with
which the stones were sealed has dropped away,
and the wind is coming through the cracks.
This mine has been worked, all right!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with pulling the stones
down?&rdquo; asked Jack. &ldquo;We ought to be able to
do that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys brought all their strength to bear
on one of the topmost stones, and it fell with a
crash into the passage.</p>
<p>They were about to put their hands to another
rock when Jack uttered an exclamation of alarm
and drew Frank away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This seems to be the haunted mine all
right!&rdquo; the boy whispered, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a light
beyond this wall!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Frank put his eye to the aperture, gave one
look into the interior, and then sprang away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a wood fire, too!&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;And
there are half a dozen as ugly looking gnomes as
you ever saw sitting around it. They must
have heard us talking, or heard the stone when
it fell, for they are looking this way. It seems
to me,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;that this is one of the
quietest little Boy Scout expeditions anyone
ever heard of!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">186</div>
<p>&ldquo;Shall we try the back passage?&rdquo; asked Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to try it!&rdquo; Frank replied. &ldquo;At
least, we&rsquo;ve got to get so far away from this
chamber that they won&rsquo;t see us if they come and
look through the hole we made in the wall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The danger is,&rdquo; Jack decided, &ldquo;that they
have seen our lights or heard our voices. In
that case, here are two Boy Scouts who won&rsquo;t
be apt to get out of the tunnel for a few hundred
years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The heavy tread of footsteps and the sound
of guttural voices speaking in a tongue with which
the boys were unfamiliar were now heard on the
other side of the broken wall, and the boys
switched off their lights and started resolutely
up the steep grade by means of which they had
reached the spot. It was hard climbing and
they made slow progress.</p>
<p>While they struggled up the hard slope, after
passing the gold chamber, lights flashed in the
darkness behind them and they lay flat on their
faces, expecting every moment to hear the
sounds of determined pursuit.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">187</div>
<p>But the men who had been seen about the
fire did not advance beyond the gold chamber.
The boys heard them talking together for a
moment, and then the sound of their voices
died out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess they&rsquo;ve gone back!&rdquo; ventured Frank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe they have,&rdquo; replied Jack.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just this way, you see,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;they
would naturally expect to find a current of
running water passing through the chamber.
Well, we shut the water off, didn&rsquo;t we? That,
of itself, will render them suspicious, and they&rsquo;ll
keep up their investigation until they find the
cause of the change in the stream. I only
hope they won&rsquo;t get up to the vicinity of the pit
and find Harry before we get back to him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stopping frequently to rest, the boys crawled
on up the incline until they came to the angle
which led to the first steep passage they had
negotiated. By this time, their hands were
bleeding from contact with the rough rocks,
their breath was coming in short gasps.</p>
<p>Once around the angle, however, they stopped
and lay motionless for a moment. Then Frank
turned the eye of his searchlight upward. What
he saw at the head of the incline caused him to
grasp his companion fiercely by the shoulder
and point with a trembling finger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If that isn&rsquo;t a ghost up there,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it
is Harry!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We never left Harry as far in the hill as
that!&rdquo; Jack suggested.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">188</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then it&rsquo;s a ghost!&rdquo; Frank insisted. &ldquo;Anyway,
there&rsquo;s some one up there. I can&rsquo;t see the
whole figure, but I saw a white face for just an
instant. It must be Harry!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Up we go, then!&rdquo; Jack exclaimed.</p>
<p>The boys were not long kept in doubt as to
the identity of the figure they had seen at the
top of the incline. Before they had proceeded
half a dozen paces, an electric light flashed out,
and they saw Harry, evidently startled by the
noise of their approach, looking toward them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Harry, all right!&rdquo; Jack said. &ldquo;But
that isn&rsquo;t where we left him. He must have
crawled down alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps there&rsquo;s been a mixup on the outside,&rdquo;
Frank suggested.</p>
<p>The whispered conversation was interrupted
by a soft call from above. The boys recognized
the voice of their chum.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Frank!&rdquo; Harry whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right!&rdquo; Frank answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t make too much noise,&rdquo; Jack suggested.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve just made the discovery that
the heart of this stony old mountain is inhabited.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Inhabited?&rdquo; repeated Harry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That same!&rdquo; answered Frank, dropping to
the ground at the place where Harry sat. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
inhabited, and the inhabitants seem to
be averse to our efforts as missionaries.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">189</div>
<p>The boys talked in low tones for a moment
before Harry referred to the arrival of Ned and
Jimmie. The excitement over the possible pursuit
was so great that even this most important
event was overlooked!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose they follow us up here!&rdquo; Jack said
in a breath. &ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t got any more guns
than a rabbit!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ned and Jimmie have guns,&rdquo; Harry replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ned and Jimmie?&rdquo; repeated both boys.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure!&rdquo; answered Harry. &ldquo;You scared me
so with your talk of mountain gnomes that I
forgot to tell you that Ned and Jimmie came
into the pit by way of a hempen elevator.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are they now?&rdquo; asked Frank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They went out to see what the shooting was
about!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two boys who had arisen to their feet at
mention of their chums&rsquo; names now dropped
flat on the rock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to know what else is coming off here
tonight!&rdquo; Frank exclaimed. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a herd
of cave dwellers chasing us up from behind, and
a party of half-breeds trying to shoot us up from
in front. Tell you what I&rsquo;m going to do,&rdquo; he
went on, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to become a disciple of
Gilroy. As soon as I get back to little old New
York, I&rsquo;m going to stay there!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">190</div>
<h2 id="c18"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XVIII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">JIMMIE FINDS A WAY</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;That isn&rsquo;t one of the boys,&rdquo; Ned decided
as a figure very faintly outlined under the stars
approached the place where the two stood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it must be Gilroy!&rdquo; Jimmie chuckled.
&ldquo;I guess he got sufficiently frightened to take
a trip on our aerial elevator.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Gilroy all right,&rdquo; Ned whispered, in a
moment, with a faint suspicion of a chuckle.
&ldquo;And if he hasn&rsquo;t got the rope with him, I&rsquo;m a
goat!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never heard of a man sliding down a rope
and bringing the cord with him!&rdquo; Jimmie
laughed. &ldquo;He must be a wonder!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Directly the trembling voice of the fat confidential
clerk was heard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boys, boys!&rdquo; he whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right here!&rdquo; Ned answered.</p>
<p>The uncertain figure shot toward the boys as
if propelled from the muzzle of a gun. When
he reached the spot where they stood, he
collapsed utterly and lay groaning on the rocky
floor of the entrance to the old channel.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">191</div>
<p>&ldquo;My God!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;My God!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on up there?&rdquo; asked Ned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Murder!&rdquo; whimpered the fat clerk. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
murder going on up there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s been killed?&rdquo; asked Jimmie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know, I don&rsquo;t know!&rdquo; was the
reply. &ldquo;I sat there holding the rope until I
thought you&rsquo;d deserted me, then I tied it to a
point of rock and prepared to descend. Before
I could do so, the whole surface of the ledge
above the pit became covered with moving
figures. They swarmed toward me and I threw
myself flat on the ground. I shall never get
over the scare I received!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; said Ned, impatiently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There must have been two parties, or two
halves of the same party, coming in from
different directions,&rdquo; the confidential clerk continued,
&ldquo;for they fired shots at each other, and
I heard one body go tumbling and grinding to
the bottom of the pit. It was awful!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then what?&rdquo; asked Jimmie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then they scuffled about for a time,&rdquo; Gilroy
went on, &ldquo;and I heard more shots and some one
else fell. To the end of my life I shall hear the
grinding of his bones as he struck the rocks!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you hear any talk?&rdquo; asked Ned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know!&rdquo; was the answer. &ldquo;I
heard talk, but I can&rsquo;t tell you what was said!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">192</div>
<p>&ldquo;And then you slid down the rope?&rdquo; Jimmie
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; was the mournful reply, &ldquo;and I shall
never be able to hold a pen again. My hands
are stripped to the bone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how did you manage to bring the rope
with you?&rdquo; asked Ned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell,&rdquo; was the answer. &ldquo;I think I
must have fallen the last few feet, for when I
struck the rock the rope came tumbling down
on my head. Suppose it had broken away
before I reached the bottom,&rdquo; he added with a
shudder, &ldquo;then I should have been lying out
there where those other masses of crushed flesh
are lying. It was horrible!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ned took the cord into his hand and examined
it, being careful to step farther into the entrance
as he did so, and to turn the light of his electric
to the rear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The rope was cut!&rdquo; he said shortly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My God!&rdquo; gasped the fat clerk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cheer up!&rdquo; Jimmie whispered. &ldquo;The entertainment
has just commenced!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us get away from this awful place!&rdquo;
pleaded Gilroy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m agreeable,&rdquo; Jimmie responded. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
not stuck on this job myself. Let&rsquo;s go up to
the office and get our time!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">193</div>
<p>&ldquo;Keep still, you little grouch!&rdquo; whispered
Ned. &ldquo;Gilroy is having troubles of his own
just now. Don&rsquo;t pester him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well,&rdquo; Jimmie said, &ldquo;if my cheerful
conversation isn&rsquo;t appreciated here, I&rsquo;ll go back
and unload some of it on Harry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Harry?&rdquo; repeated Gilroy. &ldquo;Is he in this
nightmare, too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Harry&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; Jimmie answered,
resolved to get in a parting shot at the frightened
man. &ldquo;Harry&rsquo;s fine as a fiddle. He&rsquo;s got a
busted wing, and an annex on his steeple big
enough to put a bell in. That&rsquo;s all that&rsquo;s the
matter with Harry!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, Jimmie,&rdquo; Ned interposed, &ldquo;perhaps
you&rsquo;d better take Gilroy back to the place where
we left Harry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You come along, too, then!&rdquo; the boy insisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I&rsquo;d better remain here on the chance
of some of the outlaws getting into the pit,&rdquo;
Ned suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;According to all accounts, there&rsquo;s two in the
pit now,&rdquo; Jimmie chuckled as he turned away.
&ldquo;Now, Gilroy,&rdquo; he continued, taking the
frightened man by the arm, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll escort you into
the chief&rsquo;s office, and give you the third degree!
I think you&rsquo;ll learn to like this place!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">194</div>
<p>The two disappeared in the darkness, Jimmie
wisely restraining an inclination to light the way
with his electric. Ned remained at the entrance
for some moments, listening for further evidences
of an attack, but none came. Then he heard
footsteps and heard a chuckle close behind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think?&rdquo; Jimmie asked. &ldquo;Jack
and Frank have crawled out of the bottomless
pit and are back there trying to comfort Harry.
As for Gilroy, he&rsquo;s trying to send his sobs by
wireless to New York.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the use tantalizing Gilroy!&rdquo; Ned
said, unable to restrain a laugh. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got
him so scared now that he doesn&rsquo;t know
which way is from him. Why don&rsquo;t you let him
alone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I try to let him alone,&rdquo; Jimmie replied with
assumed gravity, &ldquo;but when I think how fat he
is, and how his face reminds me of a cold roast
of veal, I just can&rsquo;t help stirring him up a bit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So Jack and Frank didn&rsquo;t succeed in finding
a route out by the dry channel?&rdquo; asked Ned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess not,&rdquo; Jimmie replied. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t
stop to ask many questions, for I wanted to let
you know that they were here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; Ned said after a moment&rsquo;s silence,
&ldquo;that the war is over for tonight. There isn&rsquo;t
a whisper at the top of the cliff now.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">195</div>
<p>In order to make sure that the outlaws had
indeed departed, Ned and Jimmie stood for some
moments in the entrance just beyond the angle
of the wall.</p>
<p>While they stood there a mellow mist of light
filled the sky, revealing the sharp outlines of the
ledge at the top of the pit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps they&rsquo;re building a fire,&rdquo; suggested
Jimmie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The moon!&rdquo; replied Ned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m mighty glad to see her!&rdquo; Jimmie responded.</p>
<p>Ned looked at his watch under the hidden ray
of a searchlight and went on:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eleven o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The moon must
have been in view for some minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; Jimmie answered. &ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t
be shining on the western slope of this blooming
old dump if it hadn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In half an hour or so, then,&rdquo; Ned said, &ldquo;we
may be able to learn whether the outlaws have
indeed taken their departure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You go on in and see Frank and Jack,&rdquo;
Jimmie suggested, &ldquo;and take the rope with you.
They want to tell you something they&rsquo;ve discovered.
They wouldn&rsquo;t tell me, but I&rsquo;m
positive that they&rsquo;ve blundered on a deposit of
gold. They look happy enough to have found
a million.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope they haven&rsquo;t said anything about it
to Gilroy,&rdquo; Ned replied.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">196</div>
<p>&ldquo;Gilroy?&rdquo; repeated Jimmie scornfully. &ldquo;Why
that fat dub is scared stiff. He wouldn&rsquo;t know
the Constitution of the United States from a
declaration of war right now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go to getting into any scrapes while
I&rsquo;m gone,&rdquo; Ned advised, as he turned away
toward the tunnel. &ldquo;You stand right here and
keep watch until I come back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t breathe aloud!&rdquo; promised Jimmie.</p>
<p>The meeting between Ned and the other boys
was a joyous one. Each had been worried over
the disappearance of the other. As for Gilroy,
he welcomed the assembling of the boys as an
indication that he was soon to be taken out of the
dangerous situation in which he found himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, boys,&rdquo; Ned said, after the greetings
were over, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve got to get Harry up the incline
and out of the pit, so we may as well be at
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;According to Gilroy,&rdquo; Harry smiled, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s
a band of Bashi Bazooks up there ready to mix
with you the minute you show your faces.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The killing of two of their number undoubtedly
frightened them away,&rdquo; Ned answered.
&ldquo;At any rate, the moon is rising now,
and any danger which threatens may readily
be detected. You must understand,&rdquo; he went
on, &ldquo;that the outlaws who came to the Devil&rsquo;s
Punch Bowl expected to find you three boys
lying dead at the bottom.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">197</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why should they think that?&rdquo; asked Harry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going on the theory,&rdquo; replied Ned,
&ldquo;that this crooked little messenger boy notified
the outlaws where we were to be found before
he came to lead us to the slaughter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just about what he did!&rdquo; Jack
interposed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In that case,&rdquo; Ned continued, &ldquo;When they
saw no trace of us in the pit, they were ready to
abandon their search, probably believing that
the boy had deceived them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; Frank cut in, &ldquo;then they got
into a mixup among themselves and, according
to Gilroy, two were killed and the rest took a
hot-foot for the cool chambers of the old
mission.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way I look at it,&rdquo; Ned said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we may as well be getting Harry out,&rdquo;
Frank suggested. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll tie the rope under his
arms, use our coats for a stretcher and pull him
gently, yet firmly, up the tunnel until his back
wears out and then we&rsquo;ll turn him over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could walk up all right,&rdquo; Harry insisted,
&ldquo;if the tunnel was only high enough for me to
stand up in.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">198</div>
<p>&ldquo;But it isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Jack returned. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve all
got to crawl on our hands and knees, and you
never can do it with that bum wing of yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Frank advised, &ldquo;you never can climb
up the tunnel with a broken arm. We&rsquo;ll bundle
you up in our coats, tie you tight like a mummy
with the rope, and then pull you up. The floor
of the tunnel is so smooth that you&rsquo;ll think
you&rsquo;re out sleigh-riding on a winter night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This plan was followed, and the injured boy
was landed at the entrance of the old channel
with very little inconvenience.</p>
<p>The moon was higher in the heavens now, and
its light illuminated not only the circle of jagged
rocks which held the pit in their setting but also
a portion of the depression itself. Ned searched
the top with a field glass but found no evidence
of enemies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The way is clear, I think,&rdquo; he decided, &ldquo;and
the question now before the house is as to how
we&rsquo;re going to get that rope up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be asking foolish questions,&rdquo; Jimmie
cut in. &ldquo;Frank and Jack wormed their way
down here, didn&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed we did,&rdquo; Jack answered, &ldquo;and came
very near breaking our necks half a dozen times!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I can worm my way up!&rdquo; Jimmie
insisted. &ldquo;Here,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;you see that
crooked corner of rock twenty or thirty feet up?
Well, just throw the rope over that and I&rsquo;ll get
up that far anyway. I think I can see resting
places for the rope at intervals all the way up.
I&rsquo;m the original aerial climber!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">199</div>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want another boy with broken
limbs,&rdquo; suggested Frank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I get a tumble,&rdquo; Jimmie advised, &ldquo;you
won&rsquo;t have any trouble picking me up. You
can carry me home in your pockets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mode of climbing the precipice suggested
by the lad was not so difficult as it at first
appeared to be. With the aid of the rope, a
strong arm, and infinite daring, the boy soon
reached the lip of the pit and the rest was easy,
when all were at the top, Jimmie reminded his
companions that they had paid no attention to
the bodies of the two men who had fallen over
the precipice.</p>
<p>In spite of the protests of the others, the little
fellow insisted on swinging down the rope, now
stretching from top to bottom, and making a
search for the two bodies. When he returned
to the top, his face was a little paler than usual,
and he started away without a word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are they?&rdquo; asked Ned, provoked at the
boy&rsquo;s silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of them is the man called Huga by the
fellows in the old mission cave,&rdquo; he answered,
&ldquo;and the other is just a common mucker.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With Huga dead,&rdquo; Ned said, &ldquo;the way is
easier.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="c19"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XIX</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">A BOY SCOUT ENCOUNTER</span></h2>
<p>When the boys started back over the long and
difficult route to the camp, the moon was
shining brightly on the mountains. There were
no indications of strife anywhere. There were
no sounds to break the stillness save those made
by the boys in their passage over the loose rocks.</p>
<p>They had proceeded only a short distance
when Jimmie darted away from the group and
disappeared behind a crag which jutted out to
the west. Ned and the others stopped in their
tracks and looked about in wonder and perplexity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that little monkey up to now?&rdquo; asked
Frank rather impatiently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He may be trying to get a rabbit for breakfast,&rdquo;
Jack replied with a grin. &ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t
had anything to eat for a long time, you know,
and I presume that Jimmie is about ready to
make a meal out of granite.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">201</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Ned said in a moment, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll go
right on and leave the little rascal to his own
devices. If he gets a squirrel for breakfast,
we&rsquo;ll help him eat it, and that&rsquo;s the best we can
do!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys had proceeded but a short distance
when a sound which startled them as no other
could have done at that particular time reached
their ears. It was the high, quavering, vicious
call of the wolf pack!</p>
<p>The boys paused again and scattered, each
one taking a few steps away from the common
center. As for Gilroy, he squatted flat on the
ground and covered his fat face with trembling
fingers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wolves!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Oh, my God, wolves!&rdquo;</p>
<p>While feeling sympathy for the man lacking
entirely in physical courage, Ned could not
restrain a burst of laughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that Jimmie?&rdquo; Jack asked in a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should say not!&rdquo; answered Frank.
&ldquo;Jimmie hasn&rsquo;t got a tenor voice to that extent.
That&rsquo;s not Jimmie!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it&rsquo;s that treacherous rat of a messenger
boy!&rdquo; Harry declared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Answer him, some one!&rdquo; Frank advised,
&ldquo;and we&rsquo;ll get our hands on him.&rdquo; It was not
necessary for one of the group to answer the call,
for in a moment, almost like an echo, the
answer came from behind the boulder where
Jimmie had secreted himself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">202</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Jimmie!&rdquo; cried Frank. &ldquo;Now do
you suppose that little rat saw Norman before
we heard the call?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems that he did,&rdquo; answered Ned.
&ldquo;Jimmie rather favored the boy at first but now
there&rsquo;ll be a mixup if they meet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I hope they&rsquo;ll meet,&rdquo; grumbled Frank.
&ldquo;Just look at the trouble that boy has made for
us since we&rsquo;ve been here. He&rsquo;ll get his!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Seeing the boys standing so unconcerned and
talking so coolly, Gilroy looked up with a little
less alarm showing in his face, and finally arose
to his feet. His knees were trembling so that
they almost bent under him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you hear it?&rdquo; he asked in a shaking
voice. &ldquo;Did you hear the wolf calling to his
mates? There&rsquo;ll be a pack here directly. I
know, because I had an experience with wolves
when I was sent into the Dakotas on business
by Mr. Bosworth. Why don&rsquo;t you boys do
something?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was the call of the wolf pack all
right!&rdquo; Frank exclaimed. &ldquo;But the wolves it
summoned were only Boy Scouts of the Wolf
Patrol.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gilroy seemed overjoyed at the information,
and even ventured on toward the rock from
which the last call had proceeded.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">203</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to know why that little monkey of
a Jimmie doesn&rsquo;t show up?&rdquo; asked Jack in a
moment. &ldquo;He ought to be here now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this moment a great threshing and puffing
came from the rear of the rock, and the boys
rushed in that direction. What they saw caused
them to dance with excitement and repeat the
call of the pack until the mountains rang again.</p>
<p>Jimmie and Norman were having it out on a
level space behind the rock! They were not
doing each other any serious harm, but they
were rolling and tumbling about, locked in each
other&rsquo;s arms, at a great rate. As Ned drew
near, Jimmie gained a decided advantage, and
in a moment was calmly sitting on Norman&rsquo;s
stomach wiping the perspiration from his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wolves trying to eat each other!&rdquo; laughed
Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; stormed Jimmie, &ldquo;this ain&rsquo;t no wolf.
This is only a dirty dog that sneaked into the
pack. I&rsquo;m going to give him what&rsquo;s coming to
him! He deserves a good beating up for what
he has done to us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pry him loose!&rdquo; shouted Norman, half
laughing at the predicament in which he had
been discovered, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll tell you all about it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_204">204</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes you will!&rdquo; shouted Jimmie. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll
tell us another pack of lies and get us into more
trouble. Why,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t
believe you if you said that round thing up there
in the sky is the moon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get up,&rdquo; Ned advised, &ldquo;and give the boy a
chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jimmie arose, reluctantly, and Norman soon
got to his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said I&rsquo;d tell you all about it some day,&rdquo;
Norman began, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m going to do it right
now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t work your imagination overtime!&rdquo;
scoffed Jimmie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on!&rdquo; Ned suggested. &ldquo;Say what you
have to say. But let me tell you this,&rdquo; he went
on, &ldquo;your story will have to be pretty straight,
and not include any excursions into the land of
the enemy, in order to be believed. You must
remember that we&rsquo;ve had trouble following your
steers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you believe a word he says!&rdquo; almost
shouted Gilroy, thinking only of his own inconvenience.
&ldquo;It was his fault that I was led
to that awful Devil&rsquo;s Punch Bowl. I&rsquo;ll never get
over that experience as long as I live! It was
horrible&mdash;beyond belief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on, Norman,&rdquo; Ned advised. &ldquo;Make it
short!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_205">205</div>
<p>&ldquo;I told you once,&rdquo; the boy began, &ldquo;that
something terrible would happen to a person in
New York if I ever gave Toombs any cause to
believe that I wasn&rsquo;t perfectly loyal to his
interests.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I remember that,&rdquo; Ned answered. &ldquo;Go on!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That person,&rdquo; Norman continued, &ldquo;is my
sister, a pretty girl of eighteen&mdash;though you
wouldn&rsquo;t believe she could be pretty, being my
sister&mdash;who became employed in Toombs&rsquo; Wall
street office a year ago. We lived together upon
East Tenth street, and both had to work. When
she secured the place in Toombs&rsquo; office we
thought our fortunes were made, and for a
time everything went well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw, cut it short!&rdquo; Jimmie hinted. &ldquo;We
don&rsquo;t believe a word of it, you know, so you may
as well ring off right now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t interrupt the boy,&rdquo; Ned suggested.
&ldquo;Let him tell his story in his own way. We
have plenty of time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One day,&rdquo; Norman continued, &ldquo;a large sum
of money&mdash;something like five thousand dollars&mdash;very
mysteriously disappeared from
Toombs&rsquo; safe. At least Toombs declared the
money had been taken. Some of us never
believed the story he told.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The only person having a knowledge of the
combination of the safe except Toombs himself
was my sister. She was accused of taking the
money, and Toombs threatened prosecution.
At last he promised not to turn the matter over
to the police if we would both promise to return
the money.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">206</div>
<p>&ldquo;Gee!&rdquo; declared Jimmie in a friendlier tone.
&ldquo;That was a life sentence all right, wasn&rsquo;t it?
I don&rsquo;t believe he ever lost any money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have been paying that old thief a portion
of our wages ever since,&rdquo; Norman went on.
&ldquo;Then, a few weeks ago, when he promised to
square the whole account if I would do certain
work for him in connection with the Wolf
Patrol, I was forced to consent. He threatened
that if I did not consent he would set the law in
motion and send my sister to prison.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did he want you to do in connection
with the Wolf Patrol?&rdquo; demanded Ned. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t understand how you could help him
through the Patrol. Wall street knows little
of Boy Scouts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When you boys reached San Francisco, after
your bout with the train robbers,&rdquo; Norman
answered, &ldquo;the newspaper owned by Frank&rsquo;s
father printed a long story about the Boy
Electricians. At the end of the article was a
statement to the effect that the boys were going
into camp near Twin Peaks. Now, this is the
point toward which Toombs&rsquo; activities had been
directed for a long time.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">207</div>
<p>&ldquo;I know that,&rdquo; answered Ned. &ldquo;He is trying
to rob corporations represented by Jack&rsquo;s father
of their property.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why,&rdquo; the boy went on, &ldquo;but
he has been paying a great deal of attention to
this section for a long time. He has had
detectives here rounding up half-breeds, and
has been hunting high and low in all the abstract
offices of the west for papers which he claims
are wrongfully withheld from him. There seems
to be a great deal at stake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You bet there is,&rdquo; laughed Jack, nudging
Frank. &ldquo;There is more at stake than that old
slob knows anything about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When Toombs saw that Lawyer Bosworth&rsquo;s
son was headed for this part of the country,
accompanied by Ned Nestor, well known over
the world as a very successful juvenile detective,
he just ran around in circles, he was so excited
about it. It was then that he proposed to me
to come on here with him, ostensibly as a cook in
his camp, but really as a spy, and learn what you
boys were up to. I had to come. What else
could I do?</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was my sister in New York, waiting
for me to wipe out the unlawful indebtedness,
and I couldn&rsquo;t disappoint her. He could have
thrown her into the Tombs prison with ten
words sent by wire.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_208">208</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a pretty rotten proposition, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
demanded Jimmie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rotten is no name for it!&rdquo; agreed Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Toombs and his gang of mercenaries arrived
in the vicinity of the old Franciscan mission
long before you boys came into the mountains.
I was with him, of course, acting as cook, and
for a few days I enjoyed myself hugely. Then
you boys came in, and I was ordered to deliver
that note to Ned. But before the morning
I saw you boys in camp and delivered the note,
I had seen you all in your beds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because of some trivial disobedience of
orders, Toombs had decreed that I should go
supperless to bed. What I did, I think, was to
scorch his steak. Anyway, he said, that I
shouldn&rsquo;t have anything to eat until the next
day at noon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No wonder you grabbed for our grub
closet!&rdquo; laughed Jimmie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was good and hungry that night all right,&rdquo;
Norman answered with a smile. &ldquo;But I didn&rsquo;t
eat all the stuff I took away. I hid it in the
forest so as to be provided with food when I
finally gained the courage to beat Toombs over
the head with a club and escape.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you really think of doing that?&rdquo;
chuckled Jimmie.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">209</div>
<p>&ldquo;I thought of doing it,&rdquo; was the answer, &ldquo;but
I don&rsquo;t know whether I should ever have acquired
the courage. There was my sister waiting
in New York, you know. Anyway, I hid
the beans and part of the bread not far away
from your camp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you wake us up?&rdquo; asked Ned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wanted to,&rdquo; was the reply, &ldquo;but I didn&rsquo;t
know what to do. I was afraid you would in
some way let Toombs understand that I was
playing into your hands. I didn&rsquo;t think you
would betray me knowingly, but I thought that
some careless act on your part might send my
sister to prison.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t blame you for being cautious,&rdquo; Ned
answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The next morning, when we saw the two
in the pine woods, that is, when Toombs and I
came upon them there, Toombs laid the plot to
get Ned into his hands by sending the note which
I afterwards delivered. You must remember
that I tried to warn you at that time, boys,&rdquo; he
added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you told us to beat it!&rdquo; Frank said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_210">210</div>
<p>&ldquo;After that,&rdquo; Norman continued, &ldquo;I gave
the Indian smoke signal in order to confirm you
in the belief that I really was a Boy Scout in
good standing. I didn&rsquo;t know then that Jimmie
would start off alone to investigate and get
cornered by the half-breeds. I didn&rsquo;t know,
either,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;that the half-breeds were
so thick about the place where Frank and the
others were captured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when I warned you,&rdquo; he added, turning
to Ned, &ldquo;that the boys were in a bad fix in the
Devil&rsquo;s Punch Bowl, I did it in good faith. I
have since learned that I was followed last
night, and that the half-breed who came after
me saw the boys in the pit and went back after
the gang.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huga, Toombs&rsquo; right-hand man, was killed
at the pit, and the old man is wild with anger.
He can&rsquo;t control the half-breeds without Huga.
They have already deserted him. In fact, there
is only one person with him at the old mission
now, and that is a Hoola Indian named Sigma.
This Indian is one of the descendants of the
tribe of Indians which long claimed this property
as their own under a grant from the Mexican
government. He is said to know more about
the mountains hereabouts than any other living
person.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is he a real Hoola Indian?&rdquo; asked Frank,
rather anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is said to be,&rdquo; answered Norman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are there other Hoolas about?&rdquo; demanded
Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A few have been seen&mdash;perhaps less than a
dozen.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_211">211</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then if there really should be an extensive
deposit of gold in this section,&rdquo; Frank asked,
&ldquo;this Sigma might know something about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He would know about it if any one did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Frank beckoned Ned and Jack to one side
where they could talk without being overheard
by the others. Then Frank very briefly explained
the discovery of the gold chamber and
added:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If this Hoola Indian knows all about the
deposit of gold, he&rsquo;ll tell Toombs, and the New
York bunch will get possession of it in some way.
Now, what are we going to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps we&rsquo;d better hear Norman out first,&rdquo;
Ned said, after expressing surprise that such a
store of gold should remain so long undiscovered
by the seekers after the precious metal.
&ldquo;Norman may know something more concerning
this Indian.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where do these Indians make their headquarters?&rdquo;
Ned asked, returning to the others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one knows,&rdquo; Norman answered. &ldquo;They
come and go like ghosts. It is common talk
that they know where great deposits of gold are
located but no one has ever been able to follow
them to their store-house. They always have
plenty of virgin gold, and are very independent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you ever tried following this Sigma?&rdquo;
asked Ned.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_212">212</div>
<p>&ldquo;I followed him one moonlight night,&rdquo;
Norman replied. &ldquo;He climbed the cliff which
faces the east and backs against the Devil&rsquo;s
Punch Bowl. He made his way almost to the
summit, and there disappeared. I searched the
locality thoroughly, but all I discovered was a
great smooth space of rock overlooking the east.
Carved in deep lines upon this rock were the
outlines of the flag of Spain, crown and all! I
don&rsquo;t think anyone ever saw it before&mdash;anyone
save the Indians. After discovering it, however,
I found no difficulty in tracing it out from
the valley.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_213">213</div>
<h2 id="c20"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XX</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE FLAG ON THE CLIFF</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;And the flag on the cliff indicates the spot
where the gold was stored by nature long ago!&rdquo;
Frank whispered to Ned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon, boys,&rdquo; suggested Gilroy
stepping forward to where Ned and Frank were
standing, &ldquo;but if you&rsquo;ll kindly direct me toward
the camp, I&rsquo;ll manage to get on alone. The
fact of the matter is,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;that I&rsquo;m
faint with hunger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Faint with hunger!&rdquo; echoed Jimmie.
&ldquo;Mother of Moses! If you were half as hungry
as I am, you&rsquo;d be eating rock. I haven&rsquo;t had
anything to eat in so long that I wouldn&rsquo;t know
whether to chew a bear steak or to drink it.
I&rsquo;m near dead right now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think we&rsquo;d all better hurry back to camp,&rdquo;
Ned suggested. &ldquo;We may find something of a
mixup there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I go with you?&rdquo; asked Norman
humbly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_214">214</div>
<p>&ldquo;What about Toombs?&rdquo; asked Ned. &ldquo;If you
are seen in our company, the telegram you have
good reason to fear may be sent on to New York
as soon as he can get out of the wilderness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Norman turned paler under the light of the
moon and shrank back as if from a blow. His
voice trembled as he spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thank you for reminding me of my duty
to my sister,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;ll have
to go back to Toombs. I don&rsquo;t know what he&rsquo;ll
do to me because of my long absence, and because
of the suspicious circumstances under
which I left the camp. I&rsquo;m afraid of him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now look here, Norman,&rdquo; Frank advised,
&ldquo;this man Toombs is a welcher. He&rsquo;s a dirty
cur, and never kept a promise in his life which
it was to his interest to disregard. Whatever
you do for him, he&rsquo;ll exact the last cent of the
obligation which he has placed upon you, and
will then, at the slightest whim, turn your sister
over to the law. I don&rsquo;t want to give you any
advice calculated to get you into trouble, but
were I in your place I think I&rsquo;d go back there
and beat his head off! The more you do for
him, the stronger will be his grip upon you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I regard that as good advice!&rdquo; Jack
declared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good!&rdquo; Nestor commented.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go back with you if you want to beat
him up!&rdquo; offered Jimmie.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_215">215</div>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll go along, too,&rdquo; Harry said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
got a bum arm, all right, but I think I could help
push that fellow into the Devil&rsquo;s Punch Bowl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t resort to violence, boys! Don&rsquo;t resort
to violence!&rdquo; pleaded Gilroy. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
shocked now to think how the laws of our
country have been disobeyed tonight. Don&rsquo;t
go back to get into more trouble!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But look here,&rdquo; exclaimed Jimmie, &ldquo;you
don&rsquo;t know how smooth and fat and vicious
this man Toombs is. I have never seen much
of him, but I&rsquo;ll tell you right now that he
breathes out an atmosphere like that of a snake.
I&rsquo;ll get his goat yet!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be putting wild notions into the boy&rsquo;s
head,&rdquo; laughed Frank. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a better way
than that to round up the old sea-serpent. We
can get a messenger out to the telegraph
station just as quickly as he can&mdash;perhaps
quicker if we set Gilroy on the trail tonight.
Now, I&rsquo;ll write a long message to Dad and tell
him all about it, and Dad&rsquo;s got a pull in New
York.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll go to the District Attorney and calmly
announce that he&rsquo;ll smash him all to little pieces
in his newspaper if he causes the arrest of that
girl until after a full investigation has been
made. What Dad can do in the District
Attorney&rsquo;s office is a wonder! We&rsquo;ll fix old
Toombs all right, all right! We&rsquo;ll have him in
jail as soon as he gets back to New York!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_216">216</div>
<p>&ldquo;Will you start off toward the nearest telegraph
office tonight, Gilroy?&rdquo; asked Ned.
&ldquo;This is important, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give me something to eat and let me sleep
a couple of hours,&rdquo; replied the fat clerk, &ldquo;and
I&rsquo;ll gladly go! I wouldn&rsquo;t stay in this country
one more day for all the gold there is in it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; Jack cut in, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll send a telegram
to my Dad, and he&rsquo;ll co-operate with
Frank&rsquo;s ancestor, and I guess they can arrange
matters so the girl won&rsquo;t be arrested. If Dad
isn&rsquo;t in New York when the wire arrives, his
confidential clerk will attend to it. I have them
all trained to jump when I say the word. Dad
lets me do just as I please, and they have to
follow his example.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Norman,&rdquo; Ned exclaimed, &ldquo;you may
as well give Toombs the hook and come on back
to camp with us. These two boys can do more
for you in New York than a host of lawyers and
bondsmen could do in a hundred years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good sense!&rdquo; Harry exclaimed.
&ldquo;Come on back to camp with us and we&rsquo;ll fat
you up!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_217">217</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to assault the next person that
talks about eating!&rdquo; Jimmie declared. &ldquo;Here
I&rsquo;m half starved to death and you keep on talking
about eating. If you fellows had any pity
in your hearts, some of you would run on ahead
and meet me at the camp with a pie!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Frank said in a moment, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
know why we don&rsquo;t all hurry back to the camp.
We may as well talk there as here. It&rsquo;s all
right to stroll and talk in the moonlight, but I
never could be romantic when I was hungry.
It&rsquo;s agin&rsquo; human nature!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys made good progress for an hour or
more, and just as day was breaking, they came
within sight of the cliff under which their camp
was situated. They stood looking down from
a higher elevation for a moment and then Ned
pointed away to the south and east.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; he said, bending his head forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bells!&rdquo; shouted Jimmie. &ldquo;Bells ringing at
this time of the morning, away up in the Sierra
Nevada Mountains! What do you make of
that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mule bells!&rdquo; scoffed Jimmie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess that&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; Harry agreed. &ldquo;And
there are the mules,&rdquo; he went on, pointing.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve brought some one in!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If they would only stop long enough to take
me out!&rdquo; wailed Gilroy, starting off as if in
pursuit of the distant train of mules.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_218">218</div>
<p>&ldquo;Those beasts of burden are two hours&rsquo; travel
from this point,&rdquo; Frank advised. &ldquo;They look
to be only a short distance off, but you&rsquo;d have
to climb over a whole lot of land standing up on
end to get to them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now who do you think the latest arrival is?&rdquo;
asked Jimmie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably a message from Dad,&rdquo; Jack suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure of that!&rdquo; Gilroy cried, gleefully.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s an order for my recall. I&rsquo;ll soon
be out of this terrible country, safe in little old
New York! It&rsquo;s too good to be true!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys now hastened toward the cliff and,
turning sharply around the angle of rock, saw
that the camp had indeed been occupied since
their departure. A fire, which gave every indication
of having recently been built, was
burning and a number of cooking utensils stood
near by.</p>
<p>Jimmie was about to spring forward for the
purpose of making an assault on the provision
chest when Ned caught him by the arm and
held him back. Jimmie scowled but remained
silent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; Ned said in a very low whisper.
&ldquo;There are people talking in the cave! I propose
to find out what&rsquo;s going on before making
my appearance. Get the boys farther away,&rdquo;
he went on, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll see what I can learn. We
may not be out of trouble yet.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_219">219</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, that&rsquo;s the person that came in with
the mule train,&rdquo; whispered Jimmie. &ldquo;Anyone
ought to know that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know whether it is or not!&rdquo; Ned
insisted. &ldquo;Get the boys away and keep still,
all of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gilroy opened his mouth to protest against
being separated from the supply of food so near
at hand, but Jimmie clapped a hand over his
lips and led him away by main force. Then Ned
crouched under the stones of the barrier and
listened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all up with you, Bosworth!&rdquo; he heard the
voice of Toombs saying. &ldquo;You played your
last card when you came in here in person, and
I&rsquo;ve taken the trick! Now you may as well be
good!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No game is ever played out until the last
card is on the table!&rdquo; Jack&rsquo;s father was heard
to say. &ldquo;You said when you came in here,&rdquo;
the lawyer went on, &ldquo;that you would give me
information of my son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All in good time!&rdquo; replied Toombs. &ldquo;I
understand,&rdquo; the Wall street man continued
&ldquo;that you have in your possession papers showing
the location of a very valuable mine known
to exist in this section hundreds of years ago.
Inform me as to the location of this mine, and
I&rsquo;ll inform you fully regarding your son.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_220">220</div>
<p>&ldquo;Toombs,&rdquo; Bosworth replied, &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t
trust you with a dirty bone that a dog wouldn&rsquo;t
take from my hand. You&rsquo;re one of the pirates
of Wall street! You never earned an honest
dollar in your life. There are murders which
might be laid at your door. You have wrecked
private fortunes, and are no more to be trusted
than a deadly rattler!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ned chuckled at this arraignment of the man
who had given him so much trouble. The conversation
certainly was amusing to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hard words break no bones!&rdquo; laughed
Toombs. &ldquo;Say what you please, only give me
the information I demand. And I insist on
something more than the information, too,&rdquo; he
went on. &ldquo;I want your promise that the corporation
you represent will quit-claim all these
lands to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To you?&rdquo; asked Bosworth scornfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, to me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not to your clients, but to you personally?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To me, personally!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thus placing you in a position to rob and
blackmail your employers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Call it what you like,&rdquo; Toombs answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had been giving you credit for loyalty to
the members of your thieving gang,&rdquo; Bosworth
said. &ldquo;I see that I was mistaken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the information?&rdquo; demanded Toombs.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_221">221</div>
<p>&ldquo;There are no such documents as you describe
in existence!&rdquo; the lawyer answered. &ldquo;If
there are, I am ignorant of the fact.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ned heard some one moving about in the
cave, and then Toombs&rsquo; voice came again, speaking
harshly and with vicious rage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may as well accompany me to my
camp,&rdquo; Toombs said. &ldquo;We can settle matters
better there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall not leave this place!&rdquo; was the calm
reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why wait longer here?&rdquo; Toombs demanded
fiercely. &ldquo;This is a deserted camp.
The boys who occupied it yesterday are dead,
drowned at the Devil&rsquo;s Punch Bowl. Your son
with the others. You have no one in the hills
to whom you can appeal for aid. If you persist
in your refusal to deliver the papers and the
information, you shall share the same fate.
Will you come quietly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a scuffle and a blow, and when Ned
gained the interior of the cave, he saw Bosworth
lying on the floor with the blood springing
from a slight wound on the forehead. Toombs
made a motion toward his pistol-pocket as Ned
appeared, but he was too late. A blow from the
butt of the boy&rsquo;s weapon laid him on the ground
beside his victim.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_222">222</div>
<p>Then the boys all came rushing in, and Jack
was with difficulty restrained from giving the
half-conscious Toombs a very bad beating.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let him alone,&rdquo; Ned advised. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll tie
him up and take him out with us. There are
many charges which can be placed against him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack&rsquo;s father soon regained consciousness,
and there followed a long and intimate conversation
between the two. Too anxious to remain in
New York after the departure of Gilroy, the
father had followed on, trying his best to reach
Gilroy by wire, but failing. He had traveled
night and day, reaching the camp only three
hours before the arrival of the boys.</p>
<p>The reader may well understand the kind of a
meal that was prepared just after sunrise. After
even Jimmie was satisfied the boys went to
sleep, leaving Gilroy, who declared that he could
never sleep again, moving about the camp.
After a couple of hours the boys were awakened
by shrill screams issuing from the throat of the
fat clerk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Indians! The Indians!&rdquo; he shouted.</p>
<p>Ned sprang to his feet and looked keenly
about but at first saw no cause for alarm. What
he did see in a moment, however, brought a
flush of anger to his face. The place where
Toombs had lain was unoccupied! In some
mysterious manner, the fellow had made his
escape while the boys slept!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_223">223</div>
<p>&ldquo;The Indians did it!&rdquo; insisted Gilroy, his
teeth chattering with fright. &ldquo;I saw an Indian
creep up and cut the ropes. I was so frozen of
terror that I couldn&rsquo;t stop him. An awful,
painted savage! He threatened me with a
knife when I managed to look in his direction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While Gilroy was making this explanation,
Jimmie sprang to his feet and darted swiftly
out of the cave. Ned called to him to return,
but he paid no attention. In a moment the boy
was out of sight.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_224">224</div>
<h2 id="c21"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XXI</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE END OF A CROOKED ROAD</span></h2>
<p>Leaving the boys in wild commotion at the
camp, Jimmie followed swiftly on in the direction
which he believed Toombs to have taken.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I just can&rsquo;t let that geezer get away!&rdquo; the
boy muttered as he traveled over the rough
ground at great speed.</p>
<p>After half an hour&rsquo;s steady walking he came
to an elevation from which he saw two figures
moving away to the north. One of the men
seemed to him to be Toombs, while the other
might well be classed as an Indian. They
were moving at a good pace, although the Indian
was frequently obliged to assist his companion
over rocky crags.</p>
<p>The two seemed entirely unconscious of pursuit.
Indeed, as it was afterwards learned, they
were beyond the sound of Gilroy&rsquo;s voice when
he shouted out the alarm which had awakened
the boys. The fat clerk had been so frightened
that he had made no attempt to sound an alarm
until the Indian he feared was too far away to
inflict injury upon him!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_225">225</div>
<p>And so, believing that the boys still slept in
the camp, and that the escape of their prisoner
still remained undiscovered, the two made their
way, not to the old camp near the mission, but
toward the sheltered bit of ground which enclosed
the Devil&rsquo;s Punch Bowl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, I wonder why they are going there!&rdquo;
mused Jimmie, gaining upon the two fugitives
every moment. &ldquo;If that fellow who cut Toombs
out of our camp,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;should prove to
be a Hoola Indian, fully advised as to the deposit
of gold, he might give Toombs information
calculated to make us a lot of trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy was satisfied that neither Toombs nor
any of the half-breeds possessed any information
concerning the hidden mime. According to
Norman&rsquo;s story, only the Hoola Indians knew
about the wonderful deposit which the boys had
blundered upon during their trip to the underground
passage. His thought now was that the
Indian with Toombs might be leading that individual
to the treasure.</p>
<p>Wishing earnestly that he had not started
on such a mission alone, the boy followed on
until the two stopped at the very verge of the
Devil&rsquo;s Punch Bowl. By this time Jimmie was
completely exhausted. He had been on his
feet all night, laboring under great excitement,
and had had only a short bit of rest after breakfast.
He was, therefore, more than glad when
Toombs and the Indian paused at the Devil&rsquo;s
Punch Bowl and threw themselves on the
ground.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_226">226</div>
<p>Lying behind a boulder, the boy saw the
Indian pointing down into the pit, and it seemed
to him that he was directing the attention of his
companion to the old channel where he, Jimmie,
had met with such exciting adventures.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s dollars to doughnuts,&rdquo; the boy mused,
&ldquo;that that&rsquo;s Sigma, the Indian, Norman referred
to. If it is, he&rsquo;s showing Toombs where
the gold mine is. That&rsquo;s just our luck, anyway!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Foot by foot the boy passed from one rock to
another until he came within sound of the men&rsquo;s
voices. He could not understand what the
Indian was saying, but Toombs seemed to be
able to grasp the meaning of the uncouth words
used.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you say there are tons of gold under
there?&rdquo; the boy heard Toombs ask. &ldquo;Is there
any way of getting at it at once?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jimmie saw Sigma nod his head vigorously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you understand exactly what I say?&rdquo;
Toombs asked in a moment.</p>
<p>Sigma nodded again, and the Wall street
man went on:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_227">227</div>
<p>&ldquo;What we want to do right now,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;is to get the gold out without any publicity
whatever. Do you understand that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Indian looked puzzled at the long words
used, but nodded. It was evident that he
understood the general import of the other&rsquo;s
talk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The men I represent,&rdquo; Toombs went on,
&ldquo;would throw a few dirty dollars into my lap
for information which would bring them millions.
Now my idea is to get the gold out and get
away with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, Toombs,&rdquo; Jimmie whispered to himself
behind the rock, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re a dirty old
schemer!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With the gold in our possession, we can disappear
from the country, you and I. We need
never trouble ourselves about money any more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Indian nodded while a pleased smile came
over his rugged face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How many know of this mine?&rdquo; asked
Toombs.</p>
<p>Sigma held up eight fingers and pointed into
the pit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only that many?&rdquo; asked Toombs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The rest dead!&rdquo; answered Sigma.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And where are they now?&rdquo; demanded the
Wall street man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All in the mine getting out gold!&rdquo; was the
reply.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_228">228</div>
<p>&ldquo;They can get it out pretty fast, can&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;
asked Toombs.</p>
<p>The Indian nodded, and said in a guttural
voice that many great heaps of it had already
been taken out of the rock and stored in the
inner chamber. Toombs&rsquo; eyes brightened
wickedly at the information.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And they&rsquo;re all in there now?&rdquo; he asked.
&ldquo;All the heaps?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sigma nodded again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want anyone watching us,&rdquo;
Toombs explained, &ldquo;so we must make sure
about their all being in the cave. You go
through the dry channel and find out if they are
all really there, then come to the entrance and
signal to me and go back and explain what we
have planned&mdash;that I am to market the gold,
for them and receive half.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now it strikes me,&rdquo; Jimmie mused, &ldquo;that
if I were in Sigma&rsquo;s place, I wouldn&rsquo;t go into
that old channel and leave Toombs on the outside,
especially if every living person having
knowledge of the deposit of gold was on the
inside, too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Indian disappeared over the edge of the
Devil&rsquo;s Punch Bowl and made his way to the
bottom, pursuing practically the same tactics
resorted to by the boys the day before. As soon
as he disappeared in the old dry channel,
Toombs, who had carefully watched the Indian&rsquo;s
every move, proceeded to follow into the depression.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_229">229</div>
<p>The man was fat, unwieldy, and out of training,
but his greed for gold was so great, his daring
so remarkable, that he managed to reach
the bottom of the pit with only a few slight
bruises. Jimmie lay down at the lip of the pit
and regarded him quizzically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to know what the game is,&rdquo; the boy
thought.</p>
<p>The tragedy enacted before his eyes during
the next hour informed him fully on this point.</p>
<p>In a short time Sigma returned to the entrance
of the old channel and held up eight fingers to
Toombs. His face showed surprise at seeing
the Wall street man at the bottom of the pit.
After giving the signal he stood with his head
bowed for a moment, as if in deep thought, and
then turned back into the tunnel.</p>
<p>It was then that the real purpose of the Wall
street man became known. He threw off his
coat and vest and began filling the channel leading
to the crevice, now carrying away the waters
of the pool! He worked frantically until the
sweat streamed down his face in tiny rivulets,
notwithstanding the cool air of the mountain.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_230">230</div>
<p>At first he dug away with his fingers, but that
appeared to be too slow a process for his eager
haste. There were pieces of shale lying about
which the boys had used the previous afternoon,
and with these he made much better progress.</p>
<p>Although it had taken the boys a long time to
dig the trench connecting the pool with its
original outlet, it was by no means difficult for
Toombs to fill in the channel in a very short
time. Slowly but steadily the waters of the pool
lifted as the obstructions in its channel forced
the water toward the level of the old outlet.</p>
<p>While the man worked nervously, strenuously,
and with such strength as he would never have
been able to exhibit at ordinary times, Jimmie
saw the dark face of Sigma appear at the opening.
The Indian stood for an instant with
folded hands as he saw what Toombs was doing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all up with the fat Wall street man now!&rdquo;
Jimmie mused. &ldquo;The Indians are wise to the
fact that his only purpose in sending Sigma in
was to bunch those possessing information of
the mine and drown them all like a lot of baby
cats. What they&rsquo;ll do to him now will be a
plenty. I wouldn&rsquo;t be in his shoes for a good
deal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So busily was Toombs engaged in his work
that he did not hear the smothered ejaculations
or the soft footsteps of the Indian as he crept
up behind him. It was evident that he believed
the Indians to be all massed in the gold chamber.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_231">231</div>
<p>When, at last, he was seized in the muscular
grasp of the Indian, the boy saw him smile,
evidently trying to explain away his actions.
Sigma shook his head and uttered a peculiar
cry. The next moment seven Indians came
from the entrance and gathered around the now
crestfallen Wall street man.</p>
<p>There was not much talk. In fact, Jimmie
could not hear a word that was spoken. All he
knew was that there was no delay. The Indians
took up the work of filling the channel which
Toombs had begun. Then, when it was quite
full and the water was roaring and swirling into
the entrance so recently vacated, they bound
Toombs hand and foot and cast him into the
torrent.</p>
<p>Jimmie gave a low groan of horror and turned
away. He knew that Toombs fully deserved
his fate. Still, his punishment seemed to be a
brutal one. He knew that the mangled body
of the unfortunate man would be swept from
level to level and from rock to rock until it came
to the round aperture in the floor which carried
the water straight down for how many hundred
feet no one could estimate.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_232">232</div>
<p>He knew that in time the Indians would find
a way of getting out the gold unless the corporation
represented by Jack&rsquo;s father should take
advantage of the information secured by the
Boy Scouts and get the gold in advance. He
knew, too, that Toombs&rsquo; craving for gold would
at last be satisfied. For a long time his body
would swing about in eddys which whirled about
heaps of gold worthy a king&rsquo;s ransom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Serves him just right!&rdquo; the boy mused as he
turned away. &ldquo;He was the crookedest man that
ever lived. And now,&rdquo; he added with a sigh,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get back to camp and see if the boys have
been cooking anything more to eat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When he reached the camp, a great kettle of
bear stew was simmering over the fire, and Frank
and Jack were explaining to Mr. Bosworth the
story of the night and telling of the discovery
of the wonderful deposit of gold in the vicinity
of the Devil&rsquo;s Punch Bowl. The capitalist
seemed overjoyed at the success of the expedition,
and when Jimmie, in a voice not very
strong, described the death of Toombs and the
re-flooding of the mine, the silence was broken
only by exclamations of pity for the man whose
greed had led him to such a frightful death.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how are we going to get this gold out,
now that the mine is flooded?&rdquo; asked Mr. Bosworth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh,&rdquo; grinned Jimmie, &ldquo;guess we can unflood
it. I could do it myself with a good big
shovel.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_233">233</div>
<p>&ldquo;I presume the Indians will change the course
of the outlet as soon as they find some willing
to market the gold for them,&rdquo; suggested Ned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have not the least intention in the world
of robbing the Indians of all the wealth,&rdquo; Mr.
Bosworth declared. &ldquo;On the contrary, we&rsquo;ll
get the gold out and give them a fair share of
the proceeds of the mine. After dinner, we&rsquo;ll
go up and negotiate with them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you&rsquo;ll send me back to New York immediately,&rdquo;
pleaded Gilroy, turning to his employer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll all be going out directly,&rdquo; was the
reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, look here!&rdquo; Jimmie declared. &ldquo;We
came in here for a vacation, and we&rsquo;ve been
mixed up with half-breeds, and Indians, and
bears, and old Franciscan missions, built underground,
and pots of gold at the rainbow&rsquo;s end,
and a thousand other things that haven&rsquo;t given
us much joy. Now I propose that we stay here
and have our visit to the mountains out after
all this mess is cleared up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a bum arm,&rdquo; Harry exclaimed, &ldquo;but
I vote for staying in the hills a month. If I
can&rsquo;t climb trees and send Boy Scout signals
floating over the mountain tops,&rdquo; he added with
a laugh, &ldquo;I can sit here and broil bear steaks
and have all the fun in the world seeing you boys
eating them. That will be fun enough for me!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_234">234</div>
<p>&ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; he went on with an amusing grin,
&ldquo;I want to stay here long enough to make the
personal acquaintance of that flag on the cliff&mdash;the
flag of Spain, without any yellow in it, that
stands for a billion of yellow metal not far
away!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The flag on the cliff?&rdquo; repeated Mr. Bosworth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; replied Jimmie. &ldquo;There has been a
stone flag waving on the cliff over the old mine
for two or three hundred years. It isn&rsquo;t much
of a flag to look at, but it represents the kingdom
of Spain, crown and all, and the old Indians
loved it because they knew of the treasure it
guarded.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then our first visit,&rdquo; Mr. Bosworth declared,
&ldquo;shall be to the flag on the cliff!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_235">235</div>
<h2 id="c22"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XXII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">A FIGHT IN THE AIR</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;My idea of a pleasant afternoon,&rdquo; Ned said,
as they arose from a sumptuous camp dinner,
&ldquo;is to get off alone into the mountains. Mr.
Bosworth seems inclined to go with you boys
for a view of the flag on the cliff,&rdquo; he went on,
&ldquo;and so I&rsquo;ll leave you to your own amusement
while I go and get acquainted with the mountains.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You would better come with us, and see
what&rsquo;s going on at the Devil&rsquo;s Punch Bowl,&rdquo;
Jimmie advised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somehow, ever since I&rsquo;ve been here,&rdquo; Ned
went on with a smile, &ldquo;I have lived in an atmosphere
of excitement. We shall be leaving
the mountains before long, and I have a notion
that I&rsquo;d like to get up to the snow line and look
over the country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should think you&rsquo;d had enough of the snow
line at the Devil&rsquo;s Punch Bowl!&rdquo; Frank laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That wasn&rsquo;t the real snow line,&rdquo; Ned replied.
&ldquo;It was pretty cold up there, it is true, but still
we didn&rsquo;t get to the real thing.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_236">236</div>
<p>&ldquo;I should like very much to go with you,&rdquo;
Mr. Bosworth suggested, &ldquo;only my time is
limited, and I really must investigate this mine
about which so much has been said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The result of this conversation was that
Frank, Jack and Norman started away with Mr.
Bosworth, leaving Harry and Gilroy at the
camp, while Ned turned straight west and
pointed for an elevation which seemed to be
something like 10,000 feet above sea level.</p>
<p>The boy&rsquo;s days and nights for a long time had
been filled with adventure, and now he was
more than pleased to be away from all hostile
influences. The way was not difficult for a
time, and he walked along taking great draughts
of mountain air and feasting his eyes on the
wonderful landscape to the east.</p>
<p>About three o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon he came
to a cliff from which, through a break in the
chain of mountains, he could look out toward
the Pacific. The slope toward the sea was
more gradual there, and the boy gazed over
valleys in the great chain with feelings of awe
in his heart.</p>
<p>As he stood on the cliff looking out to the
west, he caught sight of an eagle perched on a
crag not far above him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_237">237</div>
<p>&ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t be a bad idea,&rdquo; the boy thought,
&ldquo;to take back an eagle as a trophy. Boy Scouts
as a rule,&rdquo; he reasoned with himself, &ldquo;are not
supposed to take the life of any wild creatures
for their own amusement or benefit. Still, I
never saw anything about an eagle that looked
very patriotic, or very much in touch with the
softer side of animal life. The eagle, notwithstanding
its prominence on the American dollar,
is merely a bird of prey, eating its game alive
and killing out of pure viciousness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The great bird finally left the crag and swung
nearer and nearer to the place where Ned stood.
The boy crouched down behind a boulder and
watched it with no little interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose it is the right thing to do,&rdquo;
Ned mused, as he drew his automatic revolver,
&ldquo;but I just naturally want that eagle in the
Boy Scout club room in New York. The boys
of the Eagle Patrol would greet him with an
ovation which he will never receive while alive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the eagle came nearer, the boy fired.
The huge monarch of the air fell at the base of
the cliff, shot through the heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; thought the boy, looking down in
dismay, &ldquo;how am I ever going to get him. It
doesn&rsquo;t seem to me that any human being can
descend this precipice.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_238">238</div>
<p>After studying the lay of the country for some
moments, Ned decided to at least make an attempt
to reach the eagle. Removing his coat,
and leaving his revolver and searchlight upon the
ledge as too cumbersome to carry, he started
down toward where the bird lay. He had indeed
reached the snow line, for the crevices in
the wall down which he clambered were filled
with frost. It was a long, long journey down
to the ledge below, and dangerous, too, but the
boy finally succeeded in reaching the spot where
the eagle lay.</p>
<p>It was a noble bird, something like seven feet
from tip to tip, and Ned realized that he would
have his hands full in conveying it to the shelf
where he had very foolishly left his coat and his
weapon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must have been out of my head to leave
the articles there!&rdquo; he exclaimed, annoyed at his
own reckless act. &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
got to climb back up that almost perpendicular
wall and get there before dark, too. If I had
only brought the things with me the way to
camp would be easier.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After several attempts to climb the wall of
rock, Ned was brought to the conclusion that
the feat was impossible. The downward climb
had been difficult, but the return was out of the
question. After a further study of the situation,
he passed along the ledge to a slope which seemed
to him to lead to the shelf above. In ten
minutes, he found to his dismay that the slope
did not connect with the shelf he sought.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_239">239</div>
<p>However, the only thing for him to do was
to proceed on the way he had chosen, in the
hope that some arrangement of surfaces would
permit of his return to the point where he had
left the articles mentioned.</p>
<p>At last he came to a narrow shelf of rock in
front of which was a straight fall of hundreds of
feet. Above him the crag rose to a height almost
as great. The shelf was not more than
two feet in width, and there were places where
the rock had crumbled away so that the breadth
was cut down to less than six inches.</p>
<p>Very much disgusted with his own thoughtlessness,
Ned turned toward a slope to the east
and tried to make his way off the dangerous
elevation. As he did so, he heard a whir of
wings and felt fanning pinions brush his back.</p>
<p>Turning he saw two huge eagles hovering in
the air hardly a yard away. Their vicious eyes
were fixed angrily upon him. Involuntarily
the boy reached for his revolver but, of course,
did not find it in its usual place. It reposed on
the shelf hundreds of feet away!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; thought the boy, &ldquo;I seem to be
having the quiet little communion with nature
I set out to attain! If these eagles actually
attack me here, unarmed as I am, I&rsquo;m afraid
there&rsquo;ll be somebody falling over the precipice
in a short time.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_240">240</div>
<p>While these thoughts were passing through
the excited mind of the boy, the eagles, after
taking a long swing in the air, approached him,
claws and beak threatening destruction.</p>
<p>It was a peculiar situation. Ned was still
standing on a ledge a little more than a foot
wide, entirely unarmed except for a large knife
which he carried in his pocket. It seemed to
him that a battle with the birds there could result
in only one way.</p>
<p>He did not entirely abandon hope, but he knew
that the chances were against him. It seemed
that one powerful stroke from a wing must send
him over the precipice.</p>
<p>He drew his knife from his pocket and opened
it. He was not a moment too soon, for at that
instant one of the eagles slashed at him with a
beak which seemed to the boy at that time to
be something like three feet in length. Threatened
with the knife, the bird flew away, but his
mate immediately continued the attack.</p>
<p>While obliged to meet only one bird at a
time, Ned succeeded admirably in fighting them
off, but directly they both charged at the same
instant, and then Ned felt the powerful beaks
tearing at his hands, at his legs and at his head.
By keeping the blade of his knife flashing constantly
before his face, he was able to protect
himself when the eagles dashed at his eyes!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_241">241</div>
<p>More than once he was thrown to the ledge
by the fanning of great wings which seemed to
the boy to be operated by sixty-horse power
motors. Time after time he lay almost at the
very verge of the precipice. Fighting desperately
with knife and feet, however, he
managed to escape the claws of the great birds.</p>
<p>Had either one of them succeeded in fastening
those powerful weapons upon the boy, he must
have been dragged from the ledge. During all
this struggle the birds had been wounded time
and again, but no fatal blow had been dealt,
and so they fought on as if determined to avenge
the death of their companion.</p>
<p>It seemed to Ned that the battle lasted for
several hours. As a matter of fact, it was over
in twenty minutes. A fortunate blow with the
knife crippled one of the wings of the fiercest
eagle so that he fluttered away into the canyon,
unable to lift his body to the attack again.
The second bird fought more warily after this,
but the boy received several wounds and several
blows from his fanning wings before a knife
thrust in the throat sent the vicious bird tumbling
into the space below.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_242">242</div>
<p>Freed from his assailants, the boy dropped on
the ledge and panted for breath. Every muscle
had been strained to its utmost tension in the
encounter, and, besides, the boy had been cruelly
wounded by his antagonists of the air.</p>
<p>He lay there resting for some moments and
then, rising, found it necessary to cut his shirt
into ribbons in order to bind up some of the
wounds which had been inflicted and from which
the blood was trickling in considerable quantities.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Talk about the great American eagle!&rdquo;
mused the boy. &ldquo;I shall never want to see one
again unless he&rsquo;s on a piece of money! The noble
bird of liberty is certainly a scrapper when it
comes down to brass tacks, but the encounter
of today shows that he is inclined to take every
advantage of an opponent!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Regarding his torn clothes ruefully, the boy
once more glanced up at the shelf where he had
very foolishly deposited his coat, his revolver
and flashlight. His hat had been torn from his
head during the first minute of the battle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It strikes me,&rdquo; he considered, &ldquo;that I&rsquo;d
better head for camp without going back after
that plunder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Through the break in the mountainous range
in which he stood he could see the red sun
dropping low down into the sky. He knew that
to attempt to secure his property would be to
give up all hope of reaching camp before the
night fell.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_243">243</div>
<p>The next question for him to consider was as
to whether he should attempt to convey the
bird he had shot into camp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I don&rsquo;t take in the prize,&rdquo; he mused with a
smile showing on his face, &ldquo;the boys will pretend
to believe that I never had any battle with
an eagle; that I received my injuries in some
other way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked down at his torn clothing and at his
bandaged wrists, and for a moment, realizing
how tired he was, resolved to abandon the prize
for the time being and make for the camp at all
speed. At last, however, the boy&rsquo;s indomitable
courage asserted itself, and he picked up the
heavy bird and started on his journey to camp.</p>
<p>Somehow the conformation of the land seemed
to always lead him away from the direction he
hoped to follow. Here a ledge he was following
wound sharply around to the south, ending
in a precipitous slope which obliged him to retrace
his steps. There a gully in the hills threw
a mountain torrent in his path. Long before he
saw the light of the campfire, he was nearly
ready to drop from exhaustion.</p>
<p>The cheerful blaze, however, brought new
courage to his heart and before long he came
within the circle of light. When he turned the
angle of the rock, Harry and Gilroy greeted
him with exclamations of dismay.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_244">244</div>
<h2 id="c23"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XXIII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE TREATY UNDER THE FLAG</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;My dear sir!&rdquo; exclaimed Gilroy as Ned,
hatless, coatless, ragged, and well covered with
blood, advanced into the firelight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, what do you think of that!&rdquo; exclaimed
Harry.</p>
<p>Ned dropped down on the ground and turned
a tired face to the others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think of a battle in the air?&rdquo; he
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not up in the air, really?&rdquo; asked Gilroy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We had battles in the air when we were
running our aeroplanes,&rdquo; commented Harry,
&ldquo;and we rather liked them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This little encounter,&rdquo; Ned explained, &ldquo;was
with a great American eagle, or eagles, rather.
The eagle is a scrapper!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he spoke he pointed to the body of the dead
bird laying just outside the illuminated circle.
Gilroy hastened in that direction, but paused
when a flutter of wind caused the feathers of the
bird to move threateningly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_245">245</div>
<p>&ldquo;Is it alive?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>Harry lifted the bird by the neck and drew it
nearer to the flame.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This eagle,&rdquo; he said with a grin, &ldquo;is about
the deadest thing I ever saw. In fact,&rdquo; he went
on, &ldquo;he is fully as dead as the eagle on a counterfeit
dollar!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did you get it?&rdquo; asked Gilroy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fought for it,&rdquo; answered Ned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know what&rsquo;s the matter with Ned,&rdquo;
Harry exclaimed. &ldquo;He hasn&rsquo;t had anything to
eat since noon, and he&rsquo;s hungry. Never try to
talk to a Boy Scout when he&rsquo;s hungry,&rdquo; he continued,
&ldquo;if you do, you&rsquo;ll get saucy answers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m hungry myself!&rdquo; Gilroy declared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Harry answered. &ldquo;You can get
supper any old time you want to. I&rsquo;d be glad
to serve as chef tonight if it wasn&rsquo;t for this bum
old arm. I could do a pretty good job cooking
with one hand, only I&rsquo;m just a little bit weak
yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gilroy at once accepted the invitation and
began preparations for supper, going about the
work awkwardly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you going to have for supper?&rdquo; he
asked after a survey of the provision shelves.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_246">246</div>
<p>&ldquo;Bear stew!&rdquo; laughed Harry, well knowing
the fat clerk&rsquo;s abhorrence of bear flesh. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re
all going to eat bear stew. But you can have a
broiled rattlesnake if you care to go and catch
one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gilroy threw up his hands in horror.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you eat rattlesnakes, really?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>Ned and Harry joined in a laugh at sight of
the clerk&rsquo;s disturbed countenance. After a
time Ned arose to assist in the preparation of
the meal, and then, for the first time, the others
took note of the absence of his coat and hat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are they?&rdquo; Harry asked, pointing from
breast to head.</p>
<p>Then Ned explained his plight and Gilroy
shuddered in sympathy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On a narrow ledge,&rdquo; he wailed, &ldquo;hundreds of
feet up in the air, a battle with two great birds
like that! I&rsquo;ve heard a great deal about the
Pacific coast,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;and have long desired
a trip like the present one, but I&rsquo;ll tell you
now that my infatuation for the west has
vanished. Now I begin to understand,&rdquo; he
continued, &ldquo;why we rarely see a very old man
west of Denver.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What becomes of &rsquo;em?&rdquo; asked Harry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are eaten by bears, and scalped by
Indians, and drowned in places like the Devil&rsquo;s
Punch Bowl, and chewed up by eagles, and
slaughtered by half-breeds!&rdquo; replied the clerk.
&ldquo;And the wonder of it all is,&rdquo; he continued,
&ldquo;that they seem to like it!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_247">247</div>
<p>When the stew was simmering merrily on the
coals and the coffee was bubbling not far away,
Ned began bringing out the dishes and clearing
away the litter of the fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; he said after a time, &ldquo;that the
others will be back for supper. It seems to me
that they are making a long trip to the Devil&rsquo;s
Punch Bowl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know why they&rsquo;re staying away such a
long time,&rdquo; Harry cut in, with a grin. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re
up on top of the mountain waving the stone
flag on the cliff. That&rsquo;s a cheerful job, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear sir!&rdquo; almost gasped Gilroy. &ldquo;My
information is to the effect that the flag on the
cliff is really carved out of stone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It certainly is carved out of stone,&rdquo; Ned
answered. &ldquo;In any other event it would have
come to an ignoble end long ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who carved it there?&rdquo; asked Harry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have no information on the subject,&rdquo; Ned
replied, &ldquo;except what common sense gives me.
The mine under the mountain was undoubtedly
discovered and worked by the Hoola Indians
who first inhabited this country. Later on, the
Franciscans came here and established their
mission. Still later, the Spaniards came and
claimed to own the country.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_248">248</div>
<p>&ldquo;It is my opinion,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;that the
flag was carved there to stand as a lasting
monument to Spain two or three hundred years
ago. Probably the Hoola Indians, whose titles
to the lands were recognized by the Spanish and
Mexican governments, chose that form of a
monument to indicate the location of the mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so,&rdquo; Harry exclaimed, &ldquo;that stone flag
has waved above millions in gold for hundreds
of years, and no one knew the significance of
it&mdash;no one except the Hoola Indians.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way it seems to me!&rdquo; Ned answered.</p>
<p>Just as the coffee and the stew were ready for
consumption, Jimmie came dashing into the
camp, closely followed by the others, with Mr.
Bosworth, unfamiliar with mountain work,
puffing along in the rear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother of Moses!&rdquo; cried Jimmie. &ldquo;I smelled
that stew away up on the snow line!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I got a whiff of the coffee from the edge
of the Devil&rsquo;s Punch Bowl,&rdquo; laughed Jack.</p>
<p>Then Jimmie caught sight of Ned&rsquo;s disheveled
appearance and began a critical examination
of the tears in his garments and his
wounds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You look,&rdquo; the boy laughed, &ldquo;like you&rsquo;d been
in a rough house at Coney Island. Where did
you get it?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_249">249</div>
<p>Mr. Bosworth now came up, and, with all
present, the story of the battle in the air was
again told.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you left your gun and your searchlight
and your coat up in the blue sky, did you?&rdquo;
demanded Jimmie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I certainly did,&rdquo; replied Ned. &ldquo;But you
step over to the barrier and see what I brought
back to represent them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jimmie did as requested and soon came back
into the firelight, dragging the dead eagle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s some bird!&rdquo; he chuckled. &ldquo;Say,
Ned,&rdquo; he went on in a moment. &ldquo;I know where
you can get all kinds of money for that. The
Sioux Indians will give a dollar apiece for the
feathers for their hair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This bird goes to the Eagle Patrol, New
York,&rdquo; Ned declared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good for you!&rdquo; shouted Jimmie. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
hang it up in the club room and give you a seat
of honor directly under it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; Gilroy interrupted,
&ldquo;but if it&rsquo;s all the same to you, Mr. Bosworth,
and to you boys, I&rsquo;d like to partake of a little
refreshment. This mountain air certainly does
bring about an appetite!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew that something was giving me an
appetite,&rdquo; grinned Jimmie, &ldquo;but I didn&rsquo;t know
what it was!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_250">250</div>
<p>&ldquo;Cripes!&rdquo; Jack laughed. &ldquo;Jimmie had just
the same kind of an appetite on the Amazon!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Jimmie&rsquo;s got just the same kind of an
appetite now, too!&rdquo; replied the boy, ladling
out a great dish of stew. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to devour
just three portions like this!&rdquo; he insisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, boys,&rdquo; Mr. Bosworth said after supper
was well under way, &ldquo;I feel obliged to start for
New York tomorrow, taking Gilroy with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you do it!&rdquo; cried Jimmie. &ldquo;We won&rsquo;t
have any fun if Gilroy goes away!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And my advice to you,&rdquo; the lawyer went on,
&ldquo;is to come along with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Dad!&rdquo; cried Jack. &ldquo;Just because you
got your business all in shape you want to drag
us off to New York.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m only giving advice,&rdquo; Mr. Bosworth replied,
with a smile. &ldquo;You boys can do just as
you please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glory be!&rdquo; shouted Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you really completed your business
here?&rdquo; asked Ned in a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; was the reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Satisfactorily?&rdquo; asked Ned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Entirely so! You see,&rdquo; the lawyer went on,
&ldquo;my theory is always to work along the lines of
least resistance. I understand, of course, that
we could establish our claim to these lands
through the courts. I understand, too, that the
Hoola Indians who claim title could be electrocuted
for the murder of Toombs. That would
clear the atmosphere of many complications.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_251">251</div>
<p>&ldquo;But it wouldn&rsquo;t be right!&rdquo; Jimmie shouted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it wouldn&rsquo;t be right,&rdquo; Mr. Bosworth
admitted. &ldquo;The Indians really have some
rights here which should be respected, and
Toombs received only his just deserts. He
never had any standing, even in Wall street.
He has betrayed every confidence for years, and
there is not a soul on earth who will mourn his
death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way I sized him up!&rdquo; Ned said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so, taking all things into consideration,&rdquo;
Mr. Bosworth went on, &ldquo;I have decided to give
the Indians a fair price for their land&mdash;more
than enough to keep them in luxury the remainder
of their lives&mdash;and to employ them to
direct the taking out of the gold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there a lot of it?&rdquo; asked Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems,&rdquo; Mr. Bosworth replied, &ldquo;that the
eight Indians now living mined the gold secretly
until a few years ago, when, believing that they
had enough for all their future needs, they
turned the waters of the pool into the mine.
At this time they had large stores of the precious
metal in an interior chamber, where one of their
number was always kept on guard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I had a peep into that chamber!&rdquo;
Jack exclaimed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_252">252</div>
<p>&ldquo;So far as I can understand, the treasure
chamber is the one you boys saw,&rdquo; Mr. Bosworth
went on, &ldquo;and you were lucky to get out alive,
too,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;Only the arrival of Ned and
Jimmie protected you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s more than Toombs did&mdash;get out
alive!&rdquo; Jimmie suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When, at some time in the near future, the
water is turned back into the other channel,&rdquo;
Mr. Bosworth said, &ldquo;the body of Toombs will
be taken out and given reverent and decent
burial. That is all that can be done for him
now. His companions in New York will never
know his fate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys sat by the campfire late that night,
discussing plans and occasionally referring some
disputed point to Mr. Bosworth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, lads,&rdquo; laughed the lawyer, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve given
you my best advice, and that is that you take
your vacation in some less dangerous locality.
However, if you won&rsquo;t follow my line of thought,
my next best advice is for you to remain in this
camp and breathe mountain air, and hunt
squirrels, and deer, and bear, for a month and
then return to New York.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think of a person remaining here when he
might go back to the big city!&rdquo; exclaimed Gilroy.
&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;the half-breeds
are likely to break out again at any moment.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_253">253</div>
<p>&ldquo;The half-breeds deserted when Huga was
killed,&rdquo; Norman replied. &ldquo;They were brought
here on day wages, and will never show up
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what are we going to do with Norman?&rdquo;
asked Jack, his attention called to the boy by
the remark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bring him back to New York with you,&rdquo;
replied Mr. Bosworth, &ldquo;and I will take pleasure
in looking after his future, also that of his
sister.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bully for you, Dad!&rdquo; Jack exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get him a job on Dad&rsquo;s paper as a reporter,&rdquo;
Frank promised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just the thing!&rdquo; exclaimed Norman.</p>
<p>The party passed a restful night, and early in
the morning Mr. Bosworth and Gilroy set out
for the return trip. As they had made no arrangements
for guides or teams, the boys
accompanied them until, from far up on the
mountainside, they saw the roofs of a little town
from which telegrams asking for horses might
be sent.</p>
<p>As the two descended the slope, the boys
waved their handkerchiefs in farewell and
promised to show up in New York within a
month.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we&rsquo;ll do it, too!&rdquo; Ned declared as they
set their faces toward their camp.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_254">254</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be in New York if we ain&rsquo;t having too
much fun here!&rdquo; Jimmie laughed.</p>
<p>During the following month the boys enjoyed
their vacation to the fullest. They slept
out on the range, hunted and fished in the cold
mountain rivers, and had, as Jimmie always
expressed it, the time of their lives. They
were back in New York on time ready for the
next adventure which might come in their way.</p>
<p>The presentation of the eagle to the Eagle
Patrol was the sensation of the year among the
Boy Scouts of New York. To this day, it
occupies the place of honor in the club room,
having been mounted by one of the most famous
taxidermists of the city.</p>
<p>Mr. Bosworth fulfilled his promise to look
after the future of Norman and his sister, and
they were soon placed at work, much to their
liking with prospects of happy lives before them.</p>
<p>Months afterward, when the employes of the
corporation represented by Mr. Bosworth,
gathered near the old Spanish Mission and the
Devil&rsquo;s Punch Bowl to remove the treasure of
gold from the mine, there was some talk among
them of the strange hieroglyphics carved high
up on the smooth surface of the rocks.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_255">255</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what it all means,&rdquo; the superintendent
of the company said, &ldquo;but while I
was in New York, talking with Mr. Bosworth,
I often heard that peculiar formation referred
to. Now,&rdquo; he added thoughtfully, &ldquo;what was it
they called it. Ah! I know,&rdquo; he added, his eyes
brightening. &ldquo;They called it THE FLAG ON
THE CLIFF.&rdquo;</p>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
